They are based on instructions I found at <gemini://home.gegeweb.org/install_lagrange_linux.gmi>. These are in French and I don't speak or read French. My loss. The author kindly provided the specific command sequence in shell that I could read those. That was all I needed. When I read the site today I had to click through an expired certificate. That's why I think it is a good idea to capture the instructions here for the next time I need them.  I made single change to his instructions. I have cloned the repository from <https://github.com/skyjake/lagrange>.\n\n## Steps to build\n\n1. Install the programs and libraries in Raspberry Pi OS to build Lagrange\n2. Create a directory to hold the repository, then change into it\n3. Clone the repository\n4. Add a \"build\" directory to the repository and change into it\n5. Run \"cmake\" to build the release\n6. Run \"make\" in the build directory and install\n7. Test it out.\n\nWhen you clone the repository you want to clone recursively and get the release branch. Below is a transcript of the commands I typed in my shell to build Lagrange on my Raspberry Pi 4.\n\n~~~shell\nsudo apt install build-essential cmake \\\n     libsdl2-dev libssl-dev libpcre3-dev \\\n     zlib1g-dev libunistring-dev git\nmkdir -p src/github.com/skyjake && cd src/github.com/skyjake \ngit clone --recursive --branch release git@github.com:skyjake/lagrange.git\nmkdir -p lagrange/build && lagrange/build\ncmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\nsudo make install\nlagrange &\n~~~\n\nThat's about it. It worked without a hitch. I'd like to thank GÃ©rald Niel who I think created the page on gegeweb.org. I attempted to leave a thank you via the web form but couldn't get past the spam screener since I didn't understand the instructions. C'est la vie.\n\n",
