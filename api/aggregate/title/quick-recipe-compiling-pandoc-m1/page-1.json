I use a similar recipe for building Pandoc on Linux (NOTE: the challenges with libiconv and Mac Ports' libiconv below if you get a build error).\n\n1. Install [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) to get a good Haskell setup (I accept all the default choices)\n    a. Use the curl example command to install it\n    b. Make sure the environment is active (e.g. source `$HOME/.ghcup/env`)\n2. Make sure GHCup is pointing at the \"recommended\" versions of GHC, Cabal, etc. (others may work but I prefer the stable releases)\n3. Clone <https://github.com/jgm/pandoc> to your local machine\n4. Check out the version you want to build (e.g. 3.1.4)\n5. Run the \"usual\" Haskell build sequence with cabal per Pandoc's installation documentation for building from source\n    a. `cabal clean`\n    b. `cabal update`\n    c. `cabal install pandoc-cli`\n\nHere's an example of the shell commands I run (I'm assuming you're installing GHCup for the first time).\n\n~~~\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh\nsource $HOME/.gchup/env\nghcup tui\nmkdir -p src/github.com/jgm/pandoc\ncd src/github.com/jgm/pandoc\ngit clone git@github.com:jgm/pandoc\ncd pandoc\ngit checkout 3.1.4\ncabal clean\ncabal update\ncabal install pandoc-cli\n~~~\n\nThis will install Pandoc in your `$HOME/.cabal/bin` directory. Make sure\nit is in your path (it should be if you've sourced the GHCup environment after you installed GHCup).\n\n## libiconv compile issues\n\nIf you use Mac Ports it can confuse Cabal/Haskell which one to link to. You'll get an error talking about undefined symbols and iconv.  To get a clean compile I've typically worked around this issue by removing the Mac Ports installed libiconv temporarily (e.g. `sudo port uninstall libiconv`, an using the \"all\" option when prompted).  After I've got a clean install of Pandoc then I re-install libiconv for those Ports based applications that need it. Putting libiconv back is important, as Mac Ports version of Git expects it.\n\n",
