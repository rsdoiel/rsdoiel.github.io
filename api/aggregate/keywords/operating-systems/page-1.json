I like the idea but found I didn't use it much due to a preference for\nbasic Raspbian. With the recent Pi-TopOS upgrades I realized getting back to basic Raspbian was relatively\nstraight forward.\n\n## The recipe\n\n1. Make sure you're running the latest Pi-TopOS based on Jessie\n2. Login into your Pi-Top normally\n3. From the Pi-Top dashboard select the \"Desktop\" icon\n4. When you see the familiar Raspbian desktop click on the following things\n\t+ Click on the Raspberry Menu (upper left corner)\n\t+ Click on Preferences\n\t+ Click on Raspberry Pi Configuration\n5. I made the following changes to my System configuration\n\t+ Under *Boot* I selected \"To CLI\"\n\t+ I unchecked *login as user \"pi\"*\n6. Restart your Pi Top\n\t+ Click on Raspberry Menu in the upper left of the desktop\n\t+ Click on shutdown\n\t+ Select *reboot*\n7. When you restart you'll see an old school console login, login as the pi user using your Pi-Top password\n8. Remove the following program use the *apt* command\n\t+ ceed-universe\n\t+ pt-dashboard\n\t+ pt-splashscreen\n\n```\n    sudo apt purge ceed-universe pt-dashboard pt-splashscreen\n```\n\nNote: pi-battery, pt-hub-controller, pt-ipc, pt-speaker are hardware drivers specific to your Pi-Top so you probably\nwant to keep them.\n\n\n\n",

}\n```\n\nAfter that everything came up fine.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nFirst, I like Raspbian Pixel. It was fun on my Pi but on an Intel box\nwith 4Gig RAM it is wicked fast.  Pixel is currently my favorite flavor \nof Debian GNU/Linux. It is simple, minimal with a consistent UI for \nan X based system. Quite lovely. \n\nIf you've got an old laptop you'd like to breath some life into \nRaspbian Stretch is the way to go.\n\n\n### steps for my install process\n\n+ Booted from a minimal Windows 7 CD to get a basic OS minus networking\n+ Used Windows 7 and the internal DVD-RW to create a Raspbian Stretch CD\n+ Booted from the Raspbian Stretch CD and installed Raspbian replacing Windows 7\n+ Used a spare WiFi dongle initially to fetch the non-free iwlwifi modules\n+ Updated my source list, re-run apt update and upgrade\n+ Rebooted and everything came up and is running\n\n",

Doiel, 2020-04-11\n\n**Mostly Oberon** is a series of blog posts documenting my exploration of the Oberon Language, Oberon System and the various rabbit wholes I inevitably fell into.\n\n## Overview\n\nOberon is a classical computer language and operating system originated by Professors Niklaus Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht at [ETH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich) circa 1987.  It was inspired by their experiences in California at the [Xerox Palo Alto Research Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_\\(company\\)).  This series of blog posts are my meandering exploration of Oberon-07 language based on [Project Oberon 2013](http://www.projectoberon.com/).\n\nNOTE: Oberon grew from Wirth's Modula, which grew from Pascal, which grew from his experiences with Algol.\n\n### My Voyage\n\nI am new to both Oberon and the Oberon System.  Oberon language is in the tradition of ALGOL, Pascal, Modula 1 and 2 as well as incorporating ideas from the parent of Object Oriented languages Simula. The Oberon language reminds me of my first programming language [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal).  Oberon's language shape is more Pascal than C. For that reason I think it has largely been overlooked.\n\nOberon-07 is Wirth's most recent refinement of the Oberon language.  It is a terse and powerful systems language.  It strikes a different computing path then many popular programming languages used in 2020.  You find its influence along with Simula in more recent popular languages like [Go](https://golang.org).\n\nWhile Wirth conceived of Oberon in the context of a whole system it's use in research and instruction means it is also well suited [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) based systems (e.g. BSD, Linux, macOS).  The difference in programming in Oberon for a POSIX system versus a native Oberon System is primarily in the modules you import. These posts will focus on using Oberon language in a POSIX environment.\n\nNOTE: Oberon was initially a project including the CERES Hardware, Oberon compiler and Oberon operating system for networked workstations.\n\nThe latest Oberon is Prof. Niklaus Wirth and Paul Reeds' Project Oberon 2013. If you want to explore it I suggest using Peter De Wachter's [emulator](https://github.com/pdewacht/oberon-risc-emu). Project Oberon also his links to the updated books and articles in PDF format which are easy to read (or print) on most computing devices.\n\n\n## A starting point\n\nI am starting my exploration with Karl Landström's [OBNC](https://miasap.se/obnc/) compiler. I am focusing on getting comfortable using and writing in the Oberon language.\n\nHere's an example of a simple \"Hello World\" program in Oberon written for a POSIX system. I've named the [source code](HelloWorld.Mod) `HelloWorld.Mod`.\n\nNOTE: In 2020 common POSIX systems include [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution) and [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS).\n\n\n~~~\n\n    MODULE HelloWorld;\n      IMPORT Out;\n    BEGIN\n      Out.String(\"Hello World!\"); Out.Ln;\n    END HelloWorld.\n\n~~~\n\n\nWhile this is longer than a Python \"hello world\" program it is much shorter than I remember writing in Java and about the same number of lines as in C. `BEGIN` and `END` are similar to our opening and closing curly braces in C and the module is the basic unit of source code in Oberon. `IMPORT` includes the module `Out` (modules are similar to a included library in C) for sending values to the console (stdout in POSIX). One thing to note, Oberon language(s) are case sensitive. All language terms are capitalized. This makes it easy to distinguish between source code written in Oberon versus the Oberon language itself.\n\nThe `Out` module includes methods for displaying various data types native\nto Oberon. There is a corresponding `In` for receiving input as well as\nsome additional modules provided with our chosen compiler implementation.\n\nModules in Oberon can include a module wide initialization block. The\n`BEGIN` through `END HelloWorld.` are an initialization block. This is\nsimilar to C or Go's \"main\" function for our POSIX environment.\n\n### OBNC\n\nIf you want to run my \"Hello World\" you need to compile it.  I have found that [OBNC](https://miasap.se/obnc/) compiler runs well on Linux, macOS and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org). Karl has also made a precompiled version that runs on Windows available too. It is the Oberon compiler I plan to use in this series of posts.\n\nOBNC compiles Oberon source into C then into machine code for the computer system you are running on. Because it is compiling to C it can function as a [cross compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler). This opens the door to [bare metal programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_machine).\n\nIf you're following along please install OBNC on your computer.  Instructions are found at https://maisap.se/obnc. Karl also has excellent documentation and is responsive to questions about his implementation. His contact methods are included on his website.\n\n\n### Running OBNC\n\nOBNC provides a Oberon-07 compiler with some optional modules for working in a POSIX environment.  Compiling our \"Hello World\" is easy from your shell or terminal.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    obnc HelloWorld.Mod\n\n~~~\n\n\nIf all goes well this should produce an executable file named `HelloWorld` (or `HelloWorld.exe` on Windows). You can now run this program with a command like `./HelloWorld` (or `HelloWorld` on Windows).\n\n### Learning more about Oberon\n\nI have faced two challenges in my exploration of Oberon, finding a compiler I was happy with (thank you Karl for OBNC) and sorting out the literature around Oberon language implementations and system versions.\n\nOberon has a rich history though it was not well known in Southern California in 2020. Oberon's history is primarily academic and European. It was commonly used in college level instruction in Europe from it's inception at ETH in the late 80's through the early 2000s. The Oberon System is an Open Source system (predating the term by a decade) and was created in the spirit of other academic systems such as BSD. There are many books (physical books as opposed to ebooks) dating from that era.  They covered the Oberon language and system of their time.  From a historical computing perspective they remain very interesting. But running Oberon on modern 2020 hardware is a little more challenging. Fortunately Prof. Emeritus Wirth and Paul Reed brought things up to date in 2013. I recommend Reed's [www.projectoberon.com](http://www.projectoberon.com) as a good place to start. He includes links to revised versions of the classic Oberon and Oberon System texts written by Wirth et el. Prof. Wirth's [website](https://inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/) is still maintained and he features links to most of his major publications. His is the canonical source of information on Oberon.\n\nNOTE: Prof. Wirth's personal website at ETH was available as of 2020-04-11. \n\nI have found the ACM [Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/) and the ETH [Research Collection](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/?locale-attribute=en) very helpful.  While much of the material is now historic it remains useful for both techniques and inspiration.  Today's hardware, even a Raspberry Pi Zero, is more resource rich than the original systems Oberon ran on.\n\nThe online community for Oberon and Oberon System seems mostly centered around a [mail list](https://lists.inf.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/oberon) at ETH and net news group [comp.lang.oberon](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.lang.oberon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Next\n\n+ Next [Modules and Procedures](../12/Mostly-Oberon-Modules.html)\n\n",

      "content": "\nTurbo Oberon, the dream\n=======================\n\nby R. S. Doiel, 2022-07-30\n\nSometimes I have odd dreams and that was true last night through early this morning. The dream was set in the future. I was already retired. It was a dream about \"Turbo Oberon\".\n\n\"Turbo Oberon\" was an Oberon language. The language compiler was named \"TO\" in my dream. A module's file extension was \".tom\", in honor of Tom Lopez (Meatball Fulton) of ZBS. There were allot of ZBS references in the dream.\n\n\"TO\" was very much a language in the Oberon-07 tradition with minor extensions when it came to bringing in modules. It allowed for a multi path search for module names. You could also express a Module import as a string allowing providing paths to the imported module.\n\nCompilation was similar to Go. Cross compilation was available out of the box by setting a few environment variables. I remember answering questions about the language and its evolution. I remember mentioning in the conversation about how I thought Go felling into the trap of complexity like Rust or C/C++ before it. The turning point for Go was generics. Complexity was the siren song to be resisted in \"Turbo Oberon\". Complexity is seductive to language designers and implementers. I was only an implementer.\n\nEvolution wise \"TO\" was built initially on the Go tool chain. As a result it featured easily cross-compiled binaries and had a rich standard set of Modules like Go but also included portable libraries for implementing graphic user interfaces. \"Turbo Oberon\" evolved as a conversation between Go and the clean simplicity of Oberon-07. Two example applications \"shipped\" with the \"TO\" compiler. They were an Oberon like Operating System (stand alone and hosted) and a Turbo Pascal like IDE. The IDE was called \"toe\" for Turbo Oberon Editor. I don't remember the name of the OS implementation but it might have been \"toos\". I remember \"TO\" caused problems for search engines and catalog systems.\n\nI remember remarking in the dream that programming in \"Turbo Oberon\" was a little like returning to my roots when I first learned to program in Turbo Pascal. Except I could run my programs regardless of the operating system or CPU architecture. \"\"TO\" compiler supported cross compilation for Unix, macOS, Windows on ARM, Intel, RISC-V. The targets were inherited from Go implementation roots.\n\nIn my dream I remember forking Go 1.18 and first replacing the front end of the compiler. I remember it was a challenge understanding the implementation and generate a Go compatible AST. The mapping between Oberon-07 and Go had its challenges. I remember first sticking to a strict Oberon-07 compiler targeting POSIX before enhancing module imports. I remember several failed attempts at getting module imports \"right\". I remember being on the fence about a map data type and going with a Maps module.  I don't remember how introspection worked but saying it was based on an ETH paper for Oberon 2.  I remember the compiler, like Go, eventually became self hosting. It supported a comments based DSL to annotating RECORD types making encoding and decoding convenient, an influence of Go and it's tool chain.\n\nI believe the \"Turbo Oberon Editor\" came first and that was followed by the operating system implementation.\n\nI remember talking about a book that influenced me called, \"Operating Systems through compilers\" but don't know who wrote it. I remember a discussion about the debt owed to Prof. Wirth. I remember that the book showed how once you really understood building the compile you could then build the OS. There was a joke riffing on the old Lisp joke but rephrased, \"all applications evolve not to a Lisp but to an embedded OS\".\n\nIt was a pleasant dream, in the dream I was older and already retired but still writing \"TO\" code and having fun with computers. I remember a closing video shot showing me typing away at what looked like the old Turbo Pascal IDE. As Mojo Sam said in **Somewhere Next Door to Reality**, \"it was a sorta a retro future\".\n",
