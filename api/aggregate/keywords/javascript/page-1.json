[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) site\nhas a nice starter app. It displays a window with Electron version info and\n'hello world'.\n\nBefore you can get going with _Electron_ you need to have a\nworking _NodeJS_ and _NPM_. I usually compile from source and this\nwas my old recipe (adjusted for v8.7.0).\n\n```shell\n    cd\n    git clone https://github.com/nodejs/node.git\n    cd node\n    git checkout v8.7.0\n    ./configure --prefix=$HOME\n    make && make install\n```\n\nTo install an _Electron Quick Start_ I added the additional steps.\n\n```shell\n    cd\n    git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start\n    cd electron-quick-start\n    npm install\n    npm start\n```\n\nNotice _Electron_ depends on a working _node_ and _npm_.  When I\ntried this recipe it failed on `npm install` with errors regarding\ninternal missing node modules.\n\nAfter some fiddling I confirmed my node/npm install failed because\nI had install the new version of over a partially installed previous\nversion. This causes the node_modules to be populated with various\nconflicting versions of internal modules.\n\nSorting that out allowed me to test the current version of\n*electron-quick-start* cloned on 2017-10-20 under _NodeJS_ v8.7.0.\n\n## Avoiding Setup Issues in the future\n\nThe *Makefile* for _NodeJS_ includes an 'uninstall' option. Revising\nmy _NodeJS_ install recipe above I now do the following to setup a machine\nto work with _NodeJS_ or _Electron_.\n\n```shell\n    git clone git@github.com:nodejs/node.git\n    cd node\n    ./configure --prefix=$HOME\n    make uninstall\n    make clean\n    make -j 5\n    make install\n```\n\nIf I am on a device with a multi-core CPU (most of the time) you can speed\nup the make process using a `-j CPU_CORE_COUNT_PLUS_ONE` option (e.g. `-j 5`\nfor my 4 core x86 laptop).\n\nOnce _node_ and _npm_ were working normally the instructions in the\n*electron-quick-start* worked flawlessly on my x86.\n\nI have tested the node install recipe change on my Pine64 Pinebook, on \nseveral Raspberry Pi 3s as well as my x86 Ubuntu Linux laptop.\n\nI have not gotten Electron up on my Pine64 Pinebook or Raspberry Pi's yet. \n`npm install` outputs errors suggesting that it is expecting an x86 architecture.\n\n",
