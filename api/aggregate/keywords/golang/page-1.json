Doiel 2017-06-16\n\nPine64's Pinebook has a 64-bit Quad-Core ARM Cortex A53 which is \nnot the same ARM processor found on a Raspberry Pi 3. As a \nresult it needs its own compiled version of Go. Fortunately cross \ncompiling Go is very straight forward. I found two helpful Gists\non GitHub discussing compiling Go for a 64-Bit ARM processor. \n\n+ [conoro's gist](https://gist.github.com/conoro/4fca191fad018b6e47922a21fab499ca)\n+ [truedat101's gist](https://gist.github.com/truedat101/5898604b1f7a1ec42d65a75fa6a0b802)\n\nI am using a Raspberry Pi 3, raspberrypi.local, as my cross compile \nhost. Go 1.8.3 is already compiled and available.  Inspired by the \ngists I worked up with this recipe to bring a Go 1.8.3 to my Pinebook.\n\n```shell\n    cd\n    mkdir -p gobuild\n    cd gobuild\n    git clone https://github.com/golang/go.git go1.8.3\n    cd go1.8.3\n    git checkout go1.8.3\n    export GOHOSTARCH=arm\n    export GOARCH=arm64\n    export GOOS=linux\n    cd src\n    ./bootstrap.bash\n```\n\nAfter the bootstrap compile is finished I switch to my Pinebook,\ncopy the bootstrap compiler to my Pinebook and use it to compile\na new go1.8.3 for Pine64.\n\n```shell\n    cd\n    scp -r raspberrypi.local:gobuild/*.tbz ./\n    tar jxvf go-linux-arm64-bootstrap.tbz\n    export GOROOT=go-linux-arm64-bootstrap\n    go-linux-arm64-bootstrap/bin/go version\n    unset GOROOT\n    git clone https://github.com/golang/go\n    cd go\n    git checkout go1.8.3\n    export GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=$HOME/go-linux-arm64-bootstrap\n    cd src\n    ./all.bash\n```\n\n_all.bash_ will successfully compile _go_ and _gofmt_ but fail on \nthe tests. It's not perfect but appears to work as I explore\nbuilding Go applications on my Pinebook. Upcoming Go releases should\nprovide better support for 64 bit ARM.\n",

Doiel 2016-08-15\n\n    UPDATE (2016-10-27, RSD): Today trying to compile Go 1.7.3 under \n    Windows 10 Pro I've am getting compile errors when the \n    assembler is being built.  I can compile go1.4.3 but see errors \n    in some of the tests results.\n\n## Initial Setup and configuration\n\nI am running Windows 10 Pro (64bit) Anniversary edition under Virtual Box. The VM was upgraded from an earlier version of Windows 10 Pro (64bit). The VM was allocated 4G or ram, 200G disc and simulating 2 cores.  After the upgrade I took the following steps\n\n+ Search with Bing for \"Bash for Windows\" \n    + Bing returns http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/\n+ Switch on developer mode for Windows\n+ Turned on Linux Subsystem Beta (searched for \"Turning on Features\")\n+ Reboot\n+ Search for \"Bash\" and clicked on \"Run Bash command\"\n+ Answered \"y\"\n+ Waited for download and extracted file system\n+ When prompted setup developer account with username/password\n    + Documentation can be found at https://aka.ms/wsldocs\n+ Exit root install shell\n+ Search for \"Bash\" locally\n+ Launched \"Bash on Ubuntu on Windows\"\n+ Authenticate with your username/password\n\n\n## Setting up Go under Bash for Windows 10\n\nWith Bash installed these are the steps I took to compile Go\nunder Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.\n\n```shell\n    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y\n    sudo apt-get autoremove\n    sudo apt-get install build-essential clang git-core unzip zip -y\n    export CGO_ENABLE=0\n    git clone https://github.com/golang/go go1.4\n    git clone https://github.com/golang/go go\n    cd go1.4\n    git checkout go1.4.3\n    cd src\n    ./all.bash\n    cd\n    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go1.4/bin\n    cd go\n    git checkout go1.7\n    cd src\n    ./all.bash\n    cd\n    export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH\n    export GOPATH=$HOME\n```\n\nNote some tests failing during compilation in both 1.4.3 and 1.7. They mostly failed\naround network sockets.  This is probably a result of the limitations in the Linux subsystem\nunder Windows.\n\nIf successful you should be able to run `go version` as well as install additional Go based software\nwith the usual `go get ...` syntax.\n\nIn your `.bashrc` or `.profile` add the following\n\n```shell\n    export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH\n    export GOPATH=$HOME\n```\n\n\n## Improved vim setup\n\nI like the vim-go packages for editing Go code in vim. They are easy to setup.\n\n```shell\n     mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle \n     curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim\n     git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-go\n```\n\nExample $HOME/.vimrc\n\n```vimrc\n    execute pathogen#infect()\n    syntax on\n    filetype plugin on\n    set ai\n    set nu\n    set smartindent\n    set tabstop=4\n    set shiftwidth=4\n    set expandtab\n    let &background = ( &background == \"dark\"? \"light\" : \"dark\" )\n    let g:vim_markdown_folding_disabled=1\n```\n\nColor schemes are browsable at [vimcolors.com](http://vimcolors.com). They can be installed in\n$HOME/.vim/colors.\n\n1. git clone and place the colorscheme\n2. place the *.vim file holding the color scheme into $HOME/.vim/colors\n3. start vim and at the : do colorscheme NAME where NAME is the scheme you want to try\n\nYou can find the default shipped color schemes in /usr/share/vim/vimNN/colors where vimNN is the version number\ne.g. /usr/share/vim/vim74/colors.\n\n\n",

Doiel, 2018-02-19\n(updated: 2018-02-22)\n\nIn 2016, Stephen Davison, asked me, \"Why use Go and Blevesearch for\nour library projects?\" After our conversation I wrote up some notes so\nI would remember. It is now 2018 and I am revising these notes. I\nthink our choice paid off.  What follows is the current state of my\nreflection on the background, rational, concerns, and risk mitigation\nstrategies so far for using [Go](https://golang.org) and\n[Blevesearch](https://blevesearch.com) for Caltech Library projects.\n\n## Background\n\nI first came across Go a few years back when it was announced as an\nOpen Source project by Google at an Google I/O event (2012). The\noriginal Go authors were Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken\nThompson. What I remember from that presentation was Go was a rather\nconsistent language with the features you need but little else.  Go\ndeveloped at Google as a response to high development costs for C/C++\nand Java in addition to challenges with performance and slow\ncompilation times.  As a language I would put Go between C/C++ and\nJava. It comes the ease of writing and reading you find in languages\nlike Python. Syntax is firmly in the C/C++ family but heavily\nsimplified. Like Java it provides many modern features including rich basic\ndata structures and garbage collection. It has a very complete standard\nlibrary and provides very good tooling.  This makes it easy to\ngenerate code level documentation, format code, test, efficiently profile, \nand debug.\n\nOften programming languages develop around a specific set of needs.\nThis is true for Go. Given the Google origin it should not be\nsurprising to find that Go's primary strengths are working with \nstructured data, I/O and concurrency. The rich standard\nlibrary is organized around a package concept. These include packages\nsupporting network protocols, file and socket I/O as well as various\nencoding and compression scheme. It has particularly strong support\nfor XML, JSON, CSV formatted data out of the box. It has a template\nlibrary for working with plain text formats as well as generating safe\nHTML. You can browse Go's standard library https://golang.org/pkg/.\n\nAn additional feature is Go's consistency. Go code that compiles under\nversion 1.0 still compiles under 1.10. Even before 1.0 code changes\nthat were breaking came with tooling to automatically updates existing\ncode.  Running code is a strong element of Go's evolution.\n\nGo is unsurprising and has even been called boring.  This turns out to\nbe a strength when building sustainable projects in a small team.\n\n\n## Why do I write Go?\n\nFor me Go is a good way to write web services, assemble websites,\ncreate search appliances and write command line (cli) utilities. When\na shell script becomes unwieldy Go is often what I turn to.  Go is\nwell suited to building tools as well as systems.  Go based command\nline tools are very easy to orchestrate with shell and Python.\n\nGo runs on all the platforms I actively use - Windows, Mac OS X, Linux\non both Intel and ARM (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Pine64). It has experimental\nsupport for Android and iOS.  I've used a tool called\n[GopherJS](http://gopherjs.org) to write web browser applications that\ntransform my command line tools into web tools with a friendlier user\ninterface (see our [BibTeX Tools](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/bibtex/webapp/)).\n\nGo supports cross compiling out of the box. This means a production\nsystem running on AWS, Google's compute engine or Microsoft's Azure\ncan be compiled from Windows, Mac OS or even a Raspberry Pi!\nDeployment is a matter of copying the (self contained) compiled binary\nonto the production system. This contrasts with other\nplatforms like Perl, PHP, Python, NodeJS and Ruby where you need to\ninstall not only your application code but all dependencies. While\ninterpretive languages retain an advantage of having a REPL, Go\nbased programs have advantages of fast compile times and easy deployment.\n\nIn many of the projects I've written in Go I've only required a few\n(if any) 3rd party libraries (packages in Go's nomenclature). This is\nquite a bit different from my experience with Perl, PHP, Python,\nNodeJS and Ruby. This is in large part a legacy of having grown up at\nGoogle before become an open source project. While the Go standard\npackages are very good there is a rich ecosystem for 3rd party\npackages for specialized needs. I've found I tend to rely only on a\nfew of them. The one I've used the most is\n[Bleve](http://blevesearch.com).\n\nBleve is a Go package for building search engines. When I originally\ncame across Bleve (around 2014), it was described as \"Lucene lite\". \n\"Lucene lite\" was an apt description, but I find it easier\nto use than Lucene. When I first used Bleve I embedded its\nfunctionality into the tools I used to process data and present web\nservices. It did not have much in the way of stand alone command line\ntooling.  Today I increasingly think of Bleve as \"Elastic Search\nlite\". It ships with a set of command line tools that include support\nfor building Bleve's indexes.  My current practice is to only embed the search\nportion of the packages. I can use the Bleve command line for the\nrest.  In 2018, Bleve is being actively developed, has a small vibrant\ncommunity and is used by [Couchbase](https://couchbase.com), a well\nestablished NoSQL player.\n\n\n## Who is using Go?\n\nMany companies use Go. The short list includes\nGoogle, Amazon, Netflix, Dropbox, Box, eBay, Pearsons and even\nWalmart and Microsoft. This came to my attention at developer conferences\nback in 2014.  People from many of these companies started\npresenting at conferences on pilot projects that had been successful\nand moved to production. Part of what drove adoption was the ease\nof development in Go along with good system performance. I also think\nthere was a growing disenchantment with alternatives like C++, C sharp\nand Java as well as the weight of the LAMP, Tomcat, and OpenStack.\n\nHighly visible Go based projects include\n\n+ [Docker](http://docker.org) and [Rocket](http://www.docker.com) - Containerization for running process in the cloud\n+ [Kubernettes](http://kubernetes.io/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - Container orchestration systems\n+ [Hugo](http://hugo.io) - the fast/popular static website generator, an alternative to Jekyll, for those who want speed\n+ [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) - a Go based web server trying to unseat Apache/NGinX focusing on easy of use plus speed\n+ [IPFS](http://ipfs.io) - a cutting edge distributed storage system based on block chains\n\n\n### Who is using Blevesearch?\n\nHere's some larger projects using Bleve.\n\n+ [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com), a NoSQL database platform are replacing Lucene with Bleve.  Currently the creator of Bleve works for them.\n+ [Hugo](http://hugo.io) can integrate with Bleve for search and index generation\n+ [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) integrates with Bleve to provide an embedded search capability\n\n\n## Managing risks\n\nIn 2014 Go was moving from bleeding to leading edge. Serious capital\nwas behind its adoption and it stopped being an exotic conference\nitem. In 2014 Bleve was definitely bleeding edge. By late 2015 and early\n2016 the program level API stabilized. People were piloting projects\nwith it. This included our small group at Caltech Library. In 2015\nnon-English language support appeared followed by a growing list\nof non-European languages in 2016. By mid 2016 we started to see \nmissing features like alternative sorting added. While Bleve isn't\nyet 1.0 (Feb. 2018) it is reliable. The primary challenge for the Bleve\nproject is documentation targeting the novice and non-Programmer users.\nBleve has proven effective as an indexing and search platform for \narchival, library, and data repository content.\n\nAdopting new software comes with risk. We have mitigated this in two ways.\n\n1. Identify alternative technology (a plan B)\n2. Architect our systems for easy decomposition and re-composition\n\nIn the case of Go, packages can be compiled to a C-Shared\nlibrary. This allows us to share working Go packages with languages\nlike Python, R, and PHP. We have included shared Go/Python modules\non our current road map for projects.\n\nFor Blevesearch the two alternatives are Solr and Elastic\nSearch. Both are well known, documented, and solid.  The costs would be\nrecommitting to a Java stack and its resource requirements. We have\nalready identified what we want to index and that could be converted\nto either platform if needed.  If we stick with Go but dropped \nBlevesearch we would swap out the Bleve specific code for Go packages \nsupporting Solr and Elastic Search.\n\n\nThe greatest risk in adopting Go for library and archive projects was \nknowledge transfer. We addressed this \nby knowledge sharing and insuring the Go codebase can \nbe used via command line programs.  Additionally \nwe are adding support for Go based Python modules.\nTraining also is available in the form of books, websites and\nonline courses ([lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/Go-tutorials/Up-Running-Go/412378-2.html) offers a \"Up Running Go\" course).\n\n\n## What are the benefits?\n\nFor library and archives software we have found Go's benefits include\nimproved back end systems performance at a lower cost, ease of development, \nease of deployment, a rich standard library focused on the types of things \nneeded in library and archival software.  Go plays nice with\nother systems (e.g. I create an API based service in Go that can easily\nbe consumed by a web browser running JavaScript or Perl/PHP/Python\ncode running under LAMP). In the library and archives setting Go \ncan become a high performance duck tape. We get the performance and \nreliability of C/Java type systems with code simplicity \nsimilar to Python.\n",

Doiel, 2018-02-24\n\nThe problem: I have written a number of Go packages at work.\nMy colleagues know Python and I'd like them to be able to use the\npackages without resorting to system calls from Python to the\ncommand line implementations. The solution is create a C-Shared\nlibrary from my Go packages, using Go's _C_ package and combine it\nwith Python's _ctypes_ package.  What follows is a series of \nsimple recipes I used to understand the details of how that worked.\n\n\n## Example 1, libtwice.go and twice.py\n\nMany of the the examples I've come across on the web start by \nshowing how to run a simple math operation on the Go side with\nnumeric values traveling round trip via the C shared library layer. \nIt is a good place to start as you only need to consider type \nconversion between both Python's runtime and Go's runtime.  It \nprovides a simple illustration of how the Go *C* package, Python's\n*ctypes* module and the toolchain work together.\n\nIn this example we have a function in Go called \"twice\" it takes\na single integer, doubles it and returns the new value.  On\nthe Go side we create a _libtwice.go_ file with an empty `main()` \nfunction.  Notice that we also import the *C* package and use \na comment decoration to indicate the function we are exporting\n(see https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/cgo and \nhttps://golang.org/cmd/cgo/\nfor full story about Go's _C_ package and _cgo_).\nPart of the what _cgo_ and the *C* package does is use the \ncomment decoration to build the signatures for the function calls\nin the shared C library.  The Go toolchain does all the heavy \nlifting in making a *C* shared library based on comment \ndirectives like \"//export\". We don't need much for our twice\nfunction.\n\n```Go\n    package main\n    \n    import (\n    \t\"C\"\n    )\n    \n    //export twice\n    func twice(i int) int {\n    \treturn i * 2\n    }\n    \n    func main() {}\n```\n\nOn the python side we need to wrap our calls to our shared library\nbringing them into the Python runtime in a useful and idiomatically\nPython way. Python provides a few ways of doing this. In my examples\nI am using the *ctypes* package.  _twice.py_ looks like this--\n\n```python\n    import ctypes\n    import os\n    \n    # Set our shared library's name\n    lib_name='libtwice'\n    \n    # Figure out shared library extension\n    uname = os.uname().sysname\n    ext = '.so'\n    if uname == 'Darwin':\n        ext = '.dylib'\n    if uname == 'Windows':\n        ext = '.dll'\n    \n    # Find our shared library and load it\n    dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n    lib = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(os.path.join(dir_path, lib_name+ext))\n    \n    # Setup our Go functions to be nicely wrapped\n    go_twice = lib.twice\n    go_twice.argtypes = [ctypes.c_int]\n    go_twice.restype = ctypes.c_int\n    \n    # Now write our Python idiomatic function\n    def twice(i):\n        return go_twice(ctypes.c_int(i))\n    \n    # We run this test code if with: python3 twice.py\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        print(\"Twice of 2 is\", twice(2))\n```\n\nNotice the amount of lifting Python's *ctypes* does for us. It provides\nfor converting C based types to their Python counter parts. Indeed the\nadditional Python source here is focused around using that functionality\nto create a simple Python function called twice. This pattern of \nbringing in a low level version of our desired function and then \npresenting in a Pythonic one is common in more complex C based Python\nmodules.  In general we need *ctypes* to access and wrapping our \nshared library. The *os* module is used so we can find our C \nshared library based on the naming conventions of our host OS. \nFor simplicity I've kept the shared library (e.g. _libtwice.so_ \nunder Linux) in the same directory as the python module \ncode _twice.py_.\n\nThe build command for Linux looks like---\n\n```shell\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libtwice.so libtwice.go\n```\n\nUnder Windows it would look like---\n\n```shell\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libtwice.dll libtwice.go\n```\n\nand Mac OS X---\n\n```shell\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libtwice.dynlib libtwice.go\n```\n\nYou can test the Python module with---\n\n```shell\n    python3 twice.py\n```\n\nNotice the filename choices. I could have called the Go shared\nlibrary anything as long as it wasn't called `twice.so`, `twice.dll`\nor `twice.dylib`. This constraint is to avoid a module name collision\nin Python.  If we had a Python script named `twice_test.py` and \nimport `twice.py` then Python needs to make a distinction between\n`twice.py` and our shared library. If you use a Python package\napproach to wrapping the shared library you would have other options\nfor voiding name collision.\n\nHere is an example of `twice_test.py` to make sure out import is\nworking.\n\n```python\n    import twice\n    print(\"Twice 3\", twice.twice(3))\n```\n\nExample 1 is our base recipe. The next examples focus on handling\nother data types but follow the same pattern.\n\n\n## Example 2, libsayhi.go and sayhi.py\n\nI found working with strings a little more nuanced. Go's concept of\nstrings are oriented to utf-8. Python has its own concept of strings \nand encoding.  Both need to pass through the C layer which assumes \nstrings are a char pointer pointing at contiguous memory ending \nin a null. The *sayhi* recipe is focused on moving a string from \nPython, to C, to Go (a one way trip this time). The example uses \nGo's *fmt* package to display the string. \n\n```go\n    package main\n    \n    import (\n    \t\"C\"\n    \t\"fmt\"\n    )\n    \n    //export say_hi\n    func say_hi(msg *C.char) {\n    \tfmt.Println(C.GoString(msg))\n    }\n    \n    func main() { }\n```\n\nThe Go source is similar to our first recipe but our Python modules\nneeds to use *ctypes* to get you Python string into shape to be\nunpacked by Go.\n\n```python\n   import ctypes\n   import os\n   \n   # Set the name of our shared library\n   lib_name = 'libsayhi'\n\n   # Figure out shared library extension\n   uname = os.uname().sysname\n   ext = '.so'\n   if uname == 'Darwin':\n       ext = '.dylib'\n   if uname == 'Windows':\n       ext = '.dll'\n   \n   # Find our shared library and load it\n   dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n   lib = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(os.path.join(dir_path, lib_name+ext))\n   \n   # Setup our Go functions to be nicely wrapped\n   go_say_hi = lib.say_hi\n   go_say_hi.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p]\n   # NOTE: we don't have a return type defined here, the message is \n   # displayed from Go\n   \n   # Now write our Python idiomatic function\n   def say_hi(txt):\n       return go_say_hi(ctypes.c_char_p(txt.encode('utf8')))\n   \n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       say_hi('Hello!')\n```\n\nPutting things together (if you are using Windows or Mac OS X\nyou'll adjust name output name, `libsayhi.so`, to match the\nfilename extension suitable for your operating system).\n\n```bash\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libsayhi.so libsayhi.go\n```\n\nand testing.\n\n```bash\n    python3 sayhi.py\n```\n\n\n## Example 3, libhelloworld.go and helloworld.py\n\nIn this example we send a Python string to Go (which expects utf-8)\nbuild our \"hello world\" message and then send it back to Python\n(which needs to do additional conversion and decoding).\n\nLike in previous examples the Go side remains very simple. The heavy\nlifting is done by the *C* package and the comment `//export`. We\nare using `C.GoString()` and `C.CString()` to flip between our native\nGo and C datatypes.\n\n```go\n    package main\n    \n    import (\n    \t\"C\"\n    \t\"fmt\"\n    )\n    \n    //export helloworld\n    func helloworld(name *C.char) *C.char {\n    \ttxt := fmt.Sprintf(\"Hello %s\", C.GoString(name))\n    \treturn C.CString(txt)\n    }\n    \n    func main() { }\n```\n\nIn the python code below the conversion process is much more detailed.\nPython isn't explicitly utf-8 like Go. Plus we're sending our Python \nstring via C's char arrays (or pointer to chars). Finally when we \ncomeback from Go via C we have to put things back in order for Python. \nOf particular note is checking how the byte arrays work then \nencoding/decoding everything as needed. We also explicitly set the result \ntype from our Go version of the helloworld function.\n\n```python\n    import ctypes\n    import os\n    \n    # Set the name of our shared library\n    lib_name = 'libhelloworld'\n\n    # Figure out shared library extension\n    uname = os.uname().sysname\n    ext = '.so'\n    if uname == 'Darwin':\n        ext = '.dylib'\n    if uname == 'Windows':\n        ext = '.dll'\n    \n    # Find our shared library and load it\n    dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n    lib = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(os.path.join(dir_path, lib_name+ext))\n    \n    # Setup our Go functions to be nicely wrapped\n    go_helloworld = lib.helloworld\n    go_helloworld.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p]\n    go_helloworld.restype = ctypes.c_char_p\n    \n    # Now write our Python idiomatic function\n    def helloworld(txt):\n        value = go_helloworld(ctypes.c_char_p(txt.encode('utf8')))\n        if not isinstance(value, bytes):\n            value = value.encode('utf-8')\n        return value.decode()\n    \n    \n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        import sys\n        if len(sys.argv) > 1:\n            print(helloworld(sys.argv[1]))\n        else:\n            print(helloworld('World'))\n```\n\nThe build recipe remains the same as the two previous examples.\n\n```bash\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libhelloworld.so libhelloworld.go\n```\n\nHere are two variations to test.\n\n```bash\n     python3 helloworld.py\n     python3 helloworld.py Jane\n```\n\n\n## Example 4, libjsonpretty.go and jsonpretty.py\n\nIn this example we send JSON encode text to the Go package,\nunpack it in Go's runtime and repack it using the `MarshalIndent()`\nfunction in Go's JSON package before sending it back as Python\nin string form.  You'll see the same encode/decode patterns as \nin our *helloworld* example.\n\nGo code\n\n```go\n    package main\n    \n    import (\n    \t\"C\"\n    \t\"encoding/json\"\n    \t\"fmt\"\n    \t\"log\"\n    )\n    \n    //export jsonpretty\n    func jsonpretty(rawSrc *C.char) *C.char {\n    \tdata := new(map[string]interface{})\n    \terr := json.Unmarshal([]byte(C.GoString(rawSrc)), &data)\n    \tif err != nil {\n    \t\tlog.Printf(\"%s\", err)\n    \t\treturn C.CString(\"\")\n    \t}\n    \tsrc, err := json.MarshalIndent(data, \"\", \"    \")\n    \tif err != nil {\n    \t\tlog.Printf(\"%s\", err)\n    \t\treturn C.CString(\"\")\n    \t}\n    \ttxt := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s\", src)\n    \treturn C.CString(txt)\n    }\n    \n    func main() {}\n```\n\nPython code\n\n```python\n    import ctypes\n    import os\n    import json\n    \n    # Set the name of our shared library\n    lib_name = 'libjsonpretty'\n\n    # Figure out shared library extension\n    uname = os.uname().sysname\n    ext = '.so'\n    if uname == 'Darwin':\n        ext = '.dylib'\n    if uname == 'Windows':\n        ext = '.dll'\n\n    dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n    lib = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(os.path.join(dir_path, lib_name+ext))\n    \n    go_jsonpretty = lib.jsonpretty\n    go_jsonpretty.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p]\n    go_jsonpretty.restype = ctypes.c_char_p\n    \n    def jsonpretty(txt):\n        value = go_jsonpretty(ctypes.c_char_p(txt.encode('utf8')))\n        if not isinstance(value, bytes):\n            value = value.encode('utf-8')\n        return value.decode()\n    \n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        src = '''\n    {\"name\":\"fred\",\"age\":25,\"height\":75,\"units\":\"inch\",\"weight\":\"239\"}\n    '''\n        value = jsonpretty(src)\n        print(\"Pretty print\")\n        print(value)\n        print(\"Decode into dict\")\n        o = json.loads(value)\n        print(o)\n```\n\nBuild command\n\n```shell\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libjsonpretty.so libjsonpretty.go\n```\n\nAs before you can run your tests with `python3 jsonpretty.py`.\n\nIn closing I would like to note that to use these examples you Python3\nwill need to be able to find the module and shared library. For \nsimplicity I've put all the code in the same directory. If your Python\ncode is spread across multiple directories you'll need to make some \nadjustments.\n\n",

Essentially this is a revisit to the problem in my\nlast post [Go based Python Modules](https://rsdoiel.github.io/blog/2018/02/24/go-based-python-modules.html) \nbut with the language pairing of Go and Julia.\n\n\n## Example 1, libtwice.go, libtwice.jl and libtwice_test.jl\n\nIn out first example we send an integer value from\nJulia to Go and back via a C shared library (written in Go). While Julia doesn't\nrequire type declarations I will be using those for clarity. Like in my previous post\nI think this implementation this is a good starting point to see how Julia interacts with\nC shared libraries. Like before I will present our Go code, an explanation \nfollowed by the Julia code and commentary.\n\nOn the Go side we create a _libtwice.go_ file with an empty `main()` \nfunction.  Notice that we also import the *C* package and use \na comment decoration to indicate the function we are exporting\n(see https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/cgo and \nhttps://golang.org/cmd/cgo/\nfor full story about Go's _C_ package and _cgo_).\nPart of the what _cgo_ and the *C* package does is use the \ncomment decoration to build the signatures for the function calls\nin the shared C library.  The Go toolchain does all the heavy \nlifting in making a *C* shared library based on comment \ndirectives like \"//export\". We don't need much for our twice\nfunction.\n\n```Go\n    package main\n    \n    import (\n    \t\"C\"\n    )\n    \n    //export twice\n    func twice(i int) int {\n    \treturn i * 2\n    }\n    \n    func main() {}\n```\n\nLike in our previous Python implementation we need to build the C shared\nlibrary before using it from Julia. Here are some example Go build commands\nfor Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. You only need to run the one that applies\nto your operating system.\n\n```shell\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libtwice.so libtwice.go\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libtwice.dll libtwice.go\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libtwice.dynlib libtwice.go\n```\n\nUnlike the Python implementation our Julia code will be split into two files. _libtwice.jl_ will\nhold our module definition and _libtwice_test.jl_ will hold our test code. In the\ncase of _libtwice.jl_ we will access the C exported function via a function named *ccall*. \nJulia doesn't require a separate module to be imported in order to access a C shared library.\nThat makes our module much simpler. We still need to be mindful of type conversion.  Both \nGo and Julia provide for rich data types and structs.  But between Go and Julia we have C \nand C's basic type system.  On the Julia side *ccall* and Julia's type system help us\nmanaging C's limitations.\n\nHere's the Julia module we'll call _libtwice.jl_.\n\n```Julia\n    module libtwice\n            \n    # We write our Julia idiomatic function\n    function twice(i::Integer)\n        ccall((:twice, \"./libtwice\"), Int32, (Int32,), i)\n    end\n\n    end\n```\n\nWe're will put the test code in a file named _libtwice\\_test.jl_. Since this isn't\nan establish \"Package\" in Julia we will use Julia's *include* statement to get bring the\ncode in then use an *import* statement to bring the module into our current name space.\n\n```Julia\n    include(\"libtwice.jl\")\n    import libtwice\n    # We run this test code for libtwice.jl\n    println(\"Twice of 2 is \", libtwice.twice(2))\n```\n\nOur test code can be run with\n\n```shell\n    julia libtwice_test.jl\n```\n\nNotice the amount of lifting that Julia's *ccall* does. The Julia code is much more compact\nas a result of not having to map values in a variable declaration. We still have the challenges \nthat Julia and Go both support richer types than C. In a practical case we should consider \nthe over head of running to two runtimes (Go's and Julia's) as well as whether or not \nimplementing as a shared library even makes sense. But if you want to leverage existing \nGo based code this approach can be useful.\n\nExample 1 is our base recipe. The next examples focus on handling\nother data types but follow the same pattern.\n\n\n## Example 2, libsayhi.go, libsayhi.jl and libsayhi_test.jl\n\nLike Python, passing strings passing to or from Julia and Go is nuanced. Go is expecting \nUTF-8 strings. Julia also supports UTF-8 but C still looks at strings as a pointer to an\naddress space that ends in a null value. Fortunately in Julia the *ccall* function combined with\nJulia's rich type system gives us straight forward ways to map those value. \nGo code remains unchanged from our Python example in the previous post. \nIn this example we use Go's *fmt* package to display the string. In the next example\nwe will round trip our string message.\n\n```go\n    package main\n    \n    import (\n    \t\"C\"\n    \t\"fmt\"\n    )\n    \n    //export say_hi\n    func say_hi(msg *C.char) {\n    \tfmt.Println(C.GoString(msg))\n    }\n    \n    func main() { }\n```\n\nThe Go source is the similar to our first recipe. No change from our\nprevious posts' Python example. It will need to be compiled to create our\nC shared library just as before. Run the go build line that applies to\nyour operating system (i.e., Linux, Windows and Mac OS X).\n\n```shell\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libsayhi.so libsayhi.go\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libsayhi.dll libsayhi.go\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libsayhi.dylib libsayhi.go\n```\n\nOur Julia module looks like this.\n\n```julia\n    module libsayhi\n\n    # Now write our Julia idiomatic function using *ccall* to access the shared library\n    function say_hi(txt::AbstractString)\n        ccall((:say_hi, \"./libsayhi\"), Int32, (Cstring,), txt)\n    end\n\n    end\n```\n\nThis code is much more compact than our Python implementation.\n\nOur test code looks like\n\n```julia\n    include(\"./libsayhi.jl\")\n    import libsayhi\n    libsayhi.say_hi(\"Hello again!\")\n```\n\nWe run our tests with\n\n```shell\n    julia libsayhi_test.jl\n```\n\n\n## Example 3, libhelloworld.go and librhelloworld.cl and libhelloworld_test.jl\n\nIn this example we send a string round trip between Julia and Go. \nMost of the boiler plate we say in Python is gone due to Julia's type system. In\naddition to using Julia's *ccall* we'll add a *convert* and *bytestring* function calls\nto bring our __Cstring__ back to a __UTF8String__ in Julia.\n\nThe Go implementation remains unchanged from our previous Go/Python implementation. \nThe heavy lifting is done by the *C* package and the comment \n`//export`. We are using `C.GoString()` and `C.CString()` to flip between \nour native\nGo and C datatypes.\n\n```go\n    package main\n    \n    import (\n    \t\"C\"\n    \t\"fmt\"\n    )\n    \n    //export helloworld\n    func helloworld(name *C.char) *C.char {\n    \ttxt := fmt.Sprintf(\"Hello %s\", C.GoString(name))\n    \treturn C.CString(txt)\n    }\n    \n    func main() { }\n```\n\nAs always we must build our C shared library from the Go code. Below is\nthe go build commands for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. Pick the line that\napplies to your operating system to build the C shared library.\n\n```shell\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libhelloworld.so libhelloworld.go\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libhelloworld.dll libhelloworld.go\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libhelloworld.dylib libhelloworld.go\n```\n\nIn our Julia, _libhelloworld.jl_, the heavy lifting of type conversion\nhappens in Julia's type system and in the *ccall* function call. Additionally we need\nto handle the conversion from __Cstring__ Julian type to __UTF8String__ explicitly\nin our return value via a functions named *convert* and *bytestring*.\n\n```julia\n    module libhelloworld\n\n    # Now write our Julia idiomatic function\n    function helloworld(txt::AbstractString)\n        value = ccall((:helloworld, \"./libhelloworld\"), Cstring, (Cstring,), txt)\n        convert(UTF8String, bytestring(value))\n    end\n\n    end\n```\n\nOur test code looks similar to our Python test implementation.\n\n```julia\n    include(\"libhelloworld.jl\")\n    import libhelloworld\n \n    if length(ARGS) > 0\n        println(libhelloworld.helloworld(join(ARGS, \" \")))\n    else\n        println(libhelloworld.helloworld(\"World\"))\n    end\n```\n\nAs before we see the Julia code is much more compact than Python's.\n\n\n## Example 4, libjsonpretty.go, libjsonpretty.jl and libjsonpretty_test.jl\n\nIn this example we send JSON encode text to the Go package,\nunpack it in Go's runtime and repack it using the `MarshalIndent()`\nfunction in Go's JSON package before sending it back to Julia\nin C string form.  You'll see the same encode/decode patterns as \nin our *libhelloworld* example.\n\nGo code\n\n```go\n    package main\n    \n    import (\n    \t\"C\"\n    \t\"encoding/json\"\n    \t\"fmt\"\n    \t\"log\"\n    )\n    \n    //export jsonpretty\n    func jsonpretty(rawSrc *C.char) *C.char {\n    \tdata := new(map[string]interface{})\n    \terr := json.Unmarshal([]byte(C.GoString(rawSrc)), &data)\n    \tif err != nil {\n    \t\tlog.Printf(\"%s\", err)\n    \t\treturn C.CString(\"\")\n    \t}\n    \tsrc, err := json.MarshalIndent(data, \"\", \"    \")\n    \tif err != nil {\n    \t\tlog.Printf(\"%s\", err)\n    \t\treturn C.CString(\"\")\n    \t}\n    \ttxt := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s\", src)\n    \treturn C.CString(txt)\n    }\n    \n    func main() {}\n```\n\nBuild commands for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X are as before, pick the one that matches\nyour operating system.\n\n```shell\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libjsonpretty.so libjsonpretty.go\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libjsonpretty.dll libjsonpretty.go\n    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libjsonpretty.dylib libjsonpretty.go\n```\n\nOur Julia module code\n\n```Julia\n    module libjsonpretty\n\n    # Now write our Julia idiomatic function\n    function jsonpretty(txt::AbstractString)\n        value = ccall((:jsonpretty, \"./libjsonpretty\"), Cstring, (Cstring,), txt)\n        convert(UTF8String, bytestring(value))\n    end\n    \n    end\n```\n\nOur Julia test code\n\n```Julia\n    include(\"./libjsonpretty.jl\")\n    import libjsonpretty\n\n    src = \"\"\"{\"name\":\"fred\",\"age\":25,\"height\":75,\"units\":\"inch\",\"weight\":\"239\"}\"\"\"\n    println(\"Our origin JSON src\", src)\n    value = libjsonpretty.jsonpretty(src)\n    println(\"And out pretty version\\n\", value)\n```\n\nAs before you can run your tests with `julia libjsonpretty_test.jl`.\n\nIn closing I would like to note that to use these examples I am assuming your\nJulia code is in the same directory as your shared C library. Julia, like Python3,\nhas a feature rich module and Package system. If you are creating a serious Julia\nproject then you need to be familiar with how Julia's package and module system works\nand place your code and shared libraries appropriately.\n\n\n",
