You need to know how to use\n>    the Oberon mouse and the way commands work in Oberon.\n\nWhat follows are notes on getting a FreeDOS 1.2[^1] and \nthen Native Oberon[^2] running under VirtualBox 6.0. You might \nwonder why these two are together. While it was\neasy to run the Native Oberon installation process that process\nassumes you have a properly partitioned hard disk and VirtualBox\nseems to skip that process. I found taking advantage of FreeDOS\nsimplified things for me.\n\nMy goal was running Oberon System 3, but setting up a Virtual Box\nwith FreeDOS 1.2 gave me a virtual machine that functions like a \n1999 era PC. From there all the steps in the Oberon instructions\njust worked.\n\n## Creating FreeDOS 1.2 Virtual Box\n\nI've been doing a bit if computer history reading and decided to\nbring up some older systems as a means to understand where\nthings were.  The first computers I had access to were 8080, 8086\nmachines running MS DOS based. My first computer programming language\nwas Turbo Pascal. Feeling a bit nostalgic I thought it would be\ninteresting to use it again and see what I remembered from the days\nof old. While PC and MS DOS no longer exist as commercial productions\nan wonderful group of Open Source hackers have brought new life into\nDOS with FreeDOS 1.2[^3]. You'll find many of your old familiar commands\nbut also some nice improvements. You can even run it under VirtualBox\nwhich is what I proceeded to do.\n\n### VirtualBox 6.0 setup\n\nThe [FreeDOS](https://freedos.org) website includes a CD ROM image\nthat you can use to install it. There are couple small hitches though\nto get it working under VirtualBox. First go to the [download](https://freedos.org/download) page and download the [CDROM \"standard\" installer\"](http://www.freedos.org/download/download/FD12CD.iso).\n\nWhile that is downloading you can setup your VirtualBox machine.\nFirst to remember is DOS compared to today's operating systems is\nfrugal in its hardware requirements. As a result I picked very modest\nsettings for my virtual machine. \n\n1. Launch VirtualBox\n2. From the menu, pick Machine then pick new\n3. Name your machine (e.g. \"FreeDOS 1.2\"), select the type: \"Other\" and Operating system of \"DOS\"\n4. Set memory size as you like, I just accepted the default 32MB\n5. Hard disk, pick \"Create a virtual hard disc now\"\n6. Hard disk file type, pick \"VHD (Virtual Hard Disk)\"\n7. Storage on physical hard disk, I picked Dynamically allocated both either is fine\n8. File location and size, I accepted the default location and size\n9. Before starting my FreeDOS box I made a couple of changes using \"settings\" menu icon\n    a. Display, I picked bumped memory up to 128M and picked VBoxSVGA with 33D acceleration (for games)\n    b. Storage, I added a second floppy drive (empty)\n    c. Network, I picked attached to NAT\n10. When looking at my virtual machine's detail page I clicked on the Optical drive (empty), click \"choose disc image\" and pointed at the downloaded installed CD\n11. Click Start.\n12. At \"Welcome to FreeDOS 1.2\" blue screen, hit TAB key\n13. You will see a line that begins with a boot instruction. Add a space than add the word \"raw\" (without quotes) press enter\n14. Follow the install instructions, when you get to \"Drive C: does not appear to be partitioned\" dialog, pick \"Yes - Partition drive C:\"\n15. On the next screen pick \"Yes - Please reboot now\"\n16. When at the \"Welcome to FreeDOS 1.2\" screen hit TAB again\n17. Once again add a space and type \"raw\" to the command then press enter\n18. Pick \"Yes - continue with the installation\"\n19. Pick \"Yes - Please erase and format drive C:\"\n20. At this point its a normal FreeDOS install\n21. When the install is done and reboots \"eject\" the virtual CD form the \"Optical Drive\" in the VirtualBox panel, then choose \"boot from system disk\",you now should have a working FreeDOS on VirtualBox\n\n## Native Oberon System 3 on Virtual Box\n\nNative Oberon can be found at http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/native/.\nThere is a related ftp site[^4] where you can download the necessary\nfiles for the stand alone version. \n\nHere's the steps I used in my Mac to download Native Oberon and\ninto a file on my desktop called \"NativeOberon-Standalone\". Open\nthe macOS Terminal application. I assume you've got a Unix\ncommand called [wget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget)\nalready installed[^5].\n\n> NOTE: The ETH ftp server is no more. I've included Web Archive\n> links and links to my own copies of the files needed to\n> install Native Oberon 2.3.6 in the paragraphs that follow.\n> RSD, 2021-03-16\n\n```bash\n\n    cd\n    mkdir -p Desktop/NativeOberon-Standalone\n    cd Desktop/NativeOberon-Standalone\n    wget ftp://ftp.ethoberon.ethz.ch/ETHOberon/Native/StdAlone/\n\n```\n\nClone your FreeDOS Box first. You'll want to do a \"Full Clone\". You'll\nalso want to \"remove\" any optical disks or floppies. You do that from\nthe virtual boxes' detail page and clicking on the drive and picking the\n\"Remove disk from virtual drive\" in the popup menu.\n\nAt this point we have a a virtual machine that is very similar to an \n1999 era PC installed with MS DOS.  [Native Oberon](http://web.archive.org/web/20190929033749/http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/native/) Normally you'd\ninstall [Native Oberon via 1.44MB floppy disks](/blog/2019/07/28/NativeOberon-StnAlone-2.3.6.zip \"Zip file of individual floppies\"). \nWe can simulate that with our Virtual machine.\nIn the folder of you downloaded there is disc called \"oberon0.dsk\". That\ncan go in our first floppy drive. But how to we get the rest of the \nfiles onto a virtual floppies? This wasn't obvious to me at first.\n\nThe Oberon install disks were organized as follows\n\n| PACKAGE    | FILENAME     | SIZE  | DSK   |\n| ---------- | ------------ | ----- | ----- |\n| Oberon-0      | [oberon0.dsk](oberon0.dsk \"boot disk\")  |          | 0 | \n| Gadgets       | [gadgets.arc](gadgets1.arc \"a modified gadgets.arc to fit 1.4 floppy\")  | 1.4  2.9 | 1 | \n| Documentation | [docu.arc](docu.arc \"documentation\")     | 1.3  2.5 | 2 | \n| Applications  | [apps.arc](apps.arc \"applications\")     | 1.3  2.8 | 3 | \n| Tutorials     | [tutorial.arc](tutorial.arc \"tutorial\") | 0.3  0.8 | 4 | \n| Pr3Fonts      | [pr3fonts.arc](pr3fonts.arc \"fonts\") | 0.3  0.6 | 4 | \n| Pr6Fonts      | [pr6fonts.arc](pr6fonts.arc \"fonts\") | 0.5  1.8 | 4 | \n| Source1       | [source1.arc](source1.arc \"Source Code\")  | 0.9  2.5 | 5 | \n| Source2       | [source2.arc](source2.arc \"Source Code\")  | 1.2  3.5 | 6 | \n| Source3       | [source3.arc](source3.arc \"Source Code\")  | 0.6  1.7 | 7 | \n\n\nIt turns out you can create 1.44MB Fat16 disc images from the\nVirtual Box 6.0 floppy drive link.  When you click on the floppy\ndrive in the details page you have a choice that includes \"create a new floppy disc\". Select this, find the disc a filename like \"disk1\". Click\non the virtual floppy disk in the Virtual Box and \"remove\"\nthe disc then create disk2, disk3, etc. In each the empty disc image\nfiles places the files from the table above. These image files can then\nbe opened on your host operating system and files copied to them. \nIt's a tedious process but this gives you something the Oberon System \ncan read and install from. Originally I just put all the files into an \nISO CD ROM image but I could not figure out how to mount that from this\nversion of Oberon. Now when you start up your Oberon V3 virtual machine\nyou can install the rest of the software like Gadgets.\n\n\n[^1]: FreeDOS is an Open Source implementation of PC/MS DOC\n\n[^2]: Native Oberon is a 1990's version of Oberon System running on i386\n\n[^3]: Download FreeDOS from http://freedos.org/download\n\n[^4]: Download Native Oberon Stand Alone from [ftp://ftp.ethoberon.ethz.ch/ETHOberon/Native/StdAlone](NativeOberon-StdAlone-2.3.6.zip \"Zip of what used to be available in that directory at ftp.ethoberon.ethz.ch\")\n\n[^5]: wget is easily installed with [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) or [Mac Ports](https://www.macports.org/)\n",
