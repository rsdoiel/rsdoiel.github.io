Doiel, 2021-11-27\n\nIn this article I'm going explore setting up FreeDOS with Qemu\non my venerable Dell 4319 running Raspberry Pi Desktop OS (Debian\nGNU/Linux).  First step is to download FreeDOS \"Live CD\" in the\n1.3 RC4 release. See http://freedos.org/download/ for that.\n\nInstalling Qemu\n---------------\n\nI needed to install Qemu in my laptop. It runs the Raspberry Pi\nDesktop OS (i.e. Debian with Raspberry Pi UI). I choose to install\nthe \"qemu-system\" package since I will likely use qemu for other\nthings besides FreeDOS. The qemu-system package contains all the\nvarious systems I might want to emulate in other projects as well\nas several qemu utilities that are handy.  Here's the full sequence\nof `apt` commands I ran (NOTE: these included making sure my laptop\nwas up to date before I installed qemu-system).\n\n~~~\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\nsudo apt install qemu-system\n~~~\n\nNow that I had the software available it was time to figure out\nhow to actually knit things together and run FreeDOS.\n\n\nObtaining FreeDOS 1.3rc4\n------------------------\n\nBefore I get started I create a folder in my home directory\nfor running everything. You can name it what you want\nbut I called mine `FreeDOS_13` and changed into that folder\nfor the work in this article.\n\n~~~\nmkdir FreeDOS_13\ncd FreeDOS_13\n~~~\n\nI initially tried the CD images but ran into odd problems with\nqemu (possibly due to my lack of experience with qemu).\nAfter looking at that various options the USB Full release\nseemed like a good choice. It comes both as an image you can\n\"burn\" to your USB drive both also as a \"vmdk\" file used with\nemulators.\n\n~~~\ncurl -L -O https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.3/previews/1.3-rc4/FD13-FullUSB.zip\nunzip FD13-FullUSB.zip\n~~~\n\nAt this point you should see the FreeDOS \"vmdk\" file, and \"img\" file and readme files if you list the directory out. I'm going to use the \"vmdk\" file to install FreeDOS on my virtual harddrive freedos.img.\n\n~~~\nls -l \n~~~\n\nPrepping my virtual machine\n---------------------------\n\nA virtual machine is not just a CPU and some random\naccess memory. A machine can include storage devices. For\nthe retro \"DOS\" experience you might looking virtual devices\nfor a \"harddrive\", \"floppy drive\" and \"CD-ROM drive\". \nQemu provides a tool called `qemu-img` for creating \nthese types of virtual devices.\n\nThe basic command is `qemu-img` using the \"create\" option with\nsome parameters.  The parameter are filename and size (see\n`man qemu-img` for gory details). I am calling my virtual\nharddrive \"freedos.img\".  With `qemu-img` the size can be\nspecified with a suffix like \"K\" for kilobytes,  \"M\" for\nmegabytes and \"G\" for gigabytes. DOS is a minimal requirements\na small (by today's standards) 750 megabyte harddrive seems\nappropriate.\n\n~~~\nqemu-img create freedos.img 750M\n~~~\n\nFor my purposes I need a harddrive so I stopped there. You\ncan always create other drives and then restart your virtual\nmachine with the appropriate options.\n\nBring up my FreeDOS box\n-----------------------\n\nNow I was ready to boot from installation media and install\nFreeDOS 1.3rc4 on my virtual harddrive.  For that I\nuse a \"qemu\" command for the system I want to emulate.\nI picked `qemu-system-i386` (see can see\nthe gory details of that command using `man qemu-system-i386`).\nTo install FreeDOS I'm going to boot from the vmdk file \nprovided for the purpose of installation. I then use the FreeDOS\ninstaller to make my freedos.img file bootable with all the\nDOS software I want to play with.\n\n~~~\nqemu-system-i386 \\\n   -m 8 \\\n   -boot menu=on,strict=on \\\n   -hda freedos.img \\\n   -hdb FD13FULL.vmdk\n~~~\n\nAt this point you should see the machine start to boot, press Esc\nwhen prompted and select the second hard drive to boot from (that's\nour vmdk drive).  The drive is then treated like the CD-ROM, follow\nthe programs instructions for installation. You will need to reboot\nseveral times during the process. Until your full installation is\ncomplete you'll need to select the second harddrive as the boot drive\nand continue the installation.\n\nThe first time I successfully installed FreeDOS 1.3rc4 I just installed\nthe plain dos. When I re-did the process I install everything. It\nfills up my 750M virtual harddrive but rc4 includes development tools\nlike a C compiler.  That I think made it worth it.\n\nHere's a Bash script you can use to build your FreeDOS machine.\n\n~~~\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ ! -f freedos.img ]; then\n  echo \"Creating fresh Harddisk as drive C:\"\n  qemu-img create freedos.img 750M\nfi\necho \"Booting machine using FD13FULL.vmdk for installation\"\nqemu-system-i386 \\\n    -m 8 \\\n    -boot menu=on,strict=on \\\n    -hda freedos.img \\\n    -hdb FD13FULL.vmdk\n~~~\n\nAnd here is one for running it.\n\n~~~\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Booting machine using freedos.img as drive C:\"\nqemu-system-i386 \\\n    -m 8 \\\n    -boot menu=on,strict=on \\\n    -hda freedos.img\n~~~\n\nNext step, explore FreeDOS and see what I can build.\n\nPutting everything together\n---------------------------\n\nBelow is a [script](run-freedos-1.3rc4.bash) I developed automating either building or running your FreeDOS setup.\n\n~~~\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ ! -f FD13FULL.vmdk ]; then\n    if [ ! -f FD13-FullUSB.zip ]; then\n      echo \"Missing FD13FULL.vmdk, downloading FD13-FullUSB.zip\"\n      curl -L -O https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.3/previews/1.3-rc4/FD13-FullUSB.zip\n    fi\n    echo \"Unzipping FD13-FullUSB.zip\"\n    unzip FD13-FullUSB.zip\nfi\n\nif [ ! -f freedos.img ]; then\n  echo \"Creating fresh Harddisk as drive C:\"\n  qemu-img create freedos.img 750M\n  echo \"Booting machine using FD13FULL.vmdk as drive C:\"\n  echo \"Installing FreeDOS on drive D:\"\n  qemu-system-i386 \\\n      -name FreeDOS \\\n      -machine pc \\\n      -m 32 \\\n      -boot order=c \\\n      -hda FD13FULL.vmdk \\\n      -hdb freedos.img \\\n      -parallel none \\\n      -vga cirrus \\\n      -display gtk\nelse\n  echo \"Booting machine using freedos.img on drive C:\"\n  qemu-system-i386 \\\n      -name FreeDOS \\\n      -machine pc \\\n      -m 32 \\\n      -boot menu=on,strict=on \\\n      -hda freedos.img \\\n      -parallel none \\\n      -vga cirrus \\\n      -display gtk\nfi\n~~~\n\n\nReference material\n------------------\n\nMy inspiration for this was the description of manual install in\nthe FreeDOS book section of the website, [Manual Install](https://www.freedos.org/books/get-started/june14-manual-install.html).\n\n\n",
