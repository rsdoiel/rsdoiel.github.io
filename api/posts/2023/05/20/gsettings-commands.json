  "content": "\n# gsettings command\n\nOne of the things I find annoying about Ubuntu Desktop defaults is that when I open a new application it opens in the upper left corner. I then drag it to the center screen and start working. It's amazing how a small inconvenience can grind on you over time.  When I've search the net for changing this behavior the usual suggestions are \"install gnome-tweaks\". This seems ham-handed. I think continue searching and eventually find the command below. So I am making a note of the command here in my blog so I can find it latter.\n\n~~~\ngsettings set org.gnome.mutter center-new-window true\n~~~\n\n",
