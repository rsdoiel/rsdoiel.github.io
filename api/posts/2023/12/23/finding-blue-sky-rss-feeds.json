This makes things much more convienient for me. \nThe RSS feed is visible via the HTML markup on a person's profile page (which are now public). E.g. My Bluesky profile page is\nat <https://bsky.app/profile/rsdoiel.bsky.social> and if you look at that pages HTML markup you'll see a link element in the head\n\n```html\n <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" href=\"/profile/did:plc:nbdlhw2imk2m2yqhwxb5ycgy/rss\">\n```\n\nThat's the RSS feed. So now if you want to follow you can expand the URL to \n\n```\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nbdlhw2imk2m2yqhwxb5ycgy/rss\n```\n\nAnd use if via your feed reader. This is a sweat feature. It allows me to move my reading from visiting the website\nto getting updates via my feed reader.\n\n\n",
