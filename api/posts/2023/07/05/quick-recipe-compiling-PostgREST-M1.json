Install [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) to get a good Haskell setup (I accept all the default choices)\n    a. Use the curl example command to install it\n    b. Make sure the environment is active (e.g. source `$HOME/.ghcup/env`)\n2. Make sure GHCup is pointing at the \"recommended\" versions of GHC, Cabal, etc. (others may work but I prefer the stable releases)\n3. Clone <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest> to your local machine\n4. Check out the version you want to build (e.g. v11.1.0)\n5. Run the \"usual\" Haskell build sequence with cabal\n    a. `cabal clean`\n    b. `cabal update`\n    c. `cabal build`\n    d. `cabal install`\n\nHere's an example of the shell commands I run (I'm assuming you're installing GHCup for the first time).\n\n~~~\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh\nsource $HOME/.gchup/env\nghcup tui\nmkdir -p src/github.com/PostgREST\ncd src/github.com/PostgREST\ngit clone git@github.com:PostgREST/postgrest\ncd postgrest\ncabal clean\ncabal update\ncabal build\ncabal install\n~~~\n\nThis will install PostgREST in your `$HOME/.cabal/bin` directory. Make sure\nit is in your path (it should be if you've sourced the GHCup environment after you installed GHCup).\n\n\n",
