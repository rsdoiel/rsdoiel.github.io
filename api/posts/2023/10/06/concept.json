  "content": "# skimmer\n\nBy R. S. Doiel, 2023-10-06\n\nI have a problem. I like to read my feeds in newsboat but I can't seem to get it working on a few machines I use.\nI miss having access to read feeds. Additionally there are times I would like to read my feeds in the same way\nI read twtxt feeds using `yarnc timeline | less -R`. Just get a list of all items in reverse chronological order.\n\nI am not interested in reinventing newsboat, it does a really good job, but I do want an option where newsboat isn't\navailable or is not not convenient to use.  This lead me to think about an experiment I am calling skimmer\n. Something that works with RSS, Atom and jsonfeeds in the same way I use `yarnc timeline | less -R`.  \nI'm also inspired by Dave Winer's a river of news site and his outline tooling. But in this case I don't want\nan output style output, just a simple list of items in reverse chronological order. I'm thinking of a more\nephemeral experience in reading.\n\nThis has left me with some questions.\n\n- How simple is would it be to write skimmer?\n- How much effort would be required to maintain it?\n- Could this tool incorporate support for other feed types, e.g. twtxt, Gopher, Gemini?\n\nThere is a Go package called [gofeed](https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed). The README describes it\nas a \"universal\" feed reading parser. That seems like a good starting point and picking a very narrowly\nfocus task seems like a way to keep the experiment simple to implement.\n\n## Design issues\n\nThe reader tool needs to output to standard out in the same manner as `yarnc timeline` does. The goal isn't\nto be newsboat, or river of news, drummer, or Lynx but to present a stream of items usefully formatted to read\nfrom standard output.\n\nSome design ideas\n\n1. Feeds should be fetched by the same tool as the reader but that should be done explicitly (downloads can take a while)\n2. I want to honor that RSS does not require titles! I need to handle that case gracefully\n3. For a given list of feed URLs I want to save the content in a SQLite3 database (useful down the road)\n4. I'd like the simplicity of newsboat's URL list but I want to eventually support OPML import/export\n\n# Skimmer, a thin wrapper around gofeed\n\nIn terms of working with RSS, Atom and JSON feeds the [gofeed](https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed) takes care of\nall the heavy lifting in parsing that content. The go http package provides a reliable client.\nThere is a pure Go package, [go-sqlite](), for integrating with SQLite 3 database. The real task is knitting this\ntogether and a convenient package.\n\nHere's some ideas about behavior.\n\nTo configure skimmer you just run the command. It'll create a directory at `$HOME/.skimmer` to store configuration\nmuch like newsboat does with `$HOME/.newsboat`.\n\n~~~\nskimmer\n~~~\n\nA default URL list to be created so when running the command you have something to fetch and read.\n\nSince fetching feed content can be slow (this is true of all news readers I've used) I think you should have to\nexplicitly say fetch.\n\n~~~\nskimmer -fetch\n~~~\n\nThis would read the URLs in the URL list and populate a simple SQLite 3 database table. Then running skimmer again \nwould display any harvested content (or running skimmer in another terminal session).\n\nSince we're accumulating data in a database there are some house keep chores like prune that need to be supported.\nInitial this can be very simple and if the experiment move forward I can improve them over time. I want something\nlike saying prune everything up to today.\n\n~~~\nskimmer -prune today\n~~~\n\nThere are times I just want to limit the number of items displayed so a limit options makes sense\n\n~~~\nskimmer -limit 10\n~~~\n\nSince I am displaying to standard out I should be able to output via Pandoc to pretty print the content.\n\n~~~\nskimmer -limit 50 | pandoc -t markdown -f plain | less -R\n~~~\n\nThat seems a like a good set of design features for an initial experiment.\n\n## Proof of concept implementation\n\nSpending a little time this evening. I've release a proof of concept on GitHub\nat <https://github.com/rsdoiel/skimmer>, you can read the initial documentation\nat [skimmer](https://rsdoiel.github.io/skimmer).\n\n",
