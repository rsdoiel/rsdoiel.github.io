It is an\nexample of the type of books I find I re-read and want in my\npersonal library. The book covers software construction through \na series of programs written in pascal. It is about how these \nprograms work, how to approach problems and write sound software.\nI was surprised I did not know about this book when I was browsing \nthe [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) this weekend.  While \nPascal was a popular in the 1980's it has faded for most people in the \nearly 21st century.  This review maybe a small bit of nostalgia. \nOn the other hand I suspect \n[\"Software Tools in Pascal\"](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL4258115M/Software_tools_in_Pascal)\nis one of the short list of computer books that will remain useful\nover the long run.\n\n\n## What's covered\n\nThe book is organized around specific programs and their implementations.\nThe implementations provided are simple and straight forward. Each\nsection is followed by a set of \"exercises\" that extend the ideas\nshown in the section. In this way you could derive the modern equivalent\nof these tools.\n\nThe topics you build tools for in the text are\nfilters, files, sorting, text patterns, editing, formatting, \nand macro processing.\n\nIf you want to follow the book along in Pascal then I think Free Pascal\navailable in many Debian distributions including Raspbian on the Raspberry\nPi is a good choice.  Likewise Wirth's Pascal is easy enough to port\nto other languages and indeed this would be a useful exercise when I\nre-read the book the next time.\n\nThe book presents a very nice set of text oriented programs to explore\nprogramming or re-connect with your programming roots.\n\n## Read the book\n\n<iframe width=\"165\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://openlibrary.org/books/OL4258115M/Software_tools_in_Pascal/widget\"></iframe>\n",
