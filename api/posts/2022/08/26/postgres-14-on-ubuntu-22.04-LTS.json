Doiel, 2022-08-26\n\nThis is just a quick set of notes for working with Postgres 14 on an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS machine.  The goal is to setup Postgres 14 and have it available for personal work under a user account (e.g. jane.doe). \n\nAssumptions\n\n- include `jane.doe` is in the sudo group\n- `jane.doe` is the one logged in and installing Postgres for machine wide use\n- `jane.doe` will want to work with her own database by default\n\nSteps\n\n1. Install Postgres\n2. Confirm installation\n3. Add `jane.doe` user providing access\n\nBelow is the commands I typed to run to complete the three steps.\n\n~~~shell\nsudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib\nsudo -u createuser --interactive\njane.doe\ny\n~~~\n\nWhat we've accomplished is installing Postgres, we've create a user in Postgres DB environment called \"jane.doe\" and given \"jane.doe\" superuser permissions, i.e. the permissions to manage Postgres databases.\n\nAt this point we have a `jane.doe` Postgres admin user. This means we can run the `psql` shell from the Jane Doe account to do any database manager tasks. To confirm I want to list the databases available\n\n~~~shell\npsql \nSELECT datname FROM pg_database;\n\\quit\n~~~\n\nNOTE: This post is a distilation of what I learned from reading Digital Ocean's [How To Install PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 22.04 \\[Quickstart\\]](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-postgresql-on-ubuntu-22-04-quickstart), April 25, 2022 by Alex Garnett.\n\n",
