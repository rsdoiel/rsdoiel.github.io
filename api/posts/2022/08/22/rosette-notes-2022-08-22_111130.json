Second issue is \"REPLACE\" is a none standard extension I picked up from MySQL [it wraps a DELETE and INSERT together](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/extensions-to-ansi.html), should be using UPDATE more than I have done in the past. The third is parameter replacement in SQL statement. This appears to be [db implementation specific](http://go-database-sql.org/prepared.html). I've used \"?\" with SQLite and MySQL but with Postgres I need to use \"$1\", \"$2\", etc. Challenging to write SQL once and have it work everywhere. Beginning to understand why GORM has traction.\n\n",
