The plan is to migrate content\nfrom rsdoiel.github.io to here and host it in a Gopher context.  It's\ninteresting learning my way around sdf.org. Reminds me of my student days\nwhen I first had access to a Unix system.  Each Unix has it own flavors and\neven for the same Unix type/version each system has it's own particular\nvariation. Unix lends itself to customization and that why one system can\n\"feel\" or \"look\" different than the next.\n\nI'm trying to remember how to use Pico (vi isn't available yet).\nDiscovering how far \"mkgopher\" can go (very far it turns out).\n\nI'm looking forward to validation so I can have access to Git and\n\"move in\" to this gopherspace in a more sustainable way.\n\nThings to read and do\n---------------------\n\n- wait to be validated\n- learn [gitia](https://git.sdf.org) and setup up a mirror my personal projects and blog\n- read up on [gophernicus](https://www.gophernicus.org/) (the gopher server used by sdf.org)\n- [twenex project](https://www.twenex.org/), sounds interesting,\n  I remember accessing a TOPS-20 system at Whitesands in New Mexico\n  once upon a time.\n- figure out to access comp.lang.oberon if it is available on sdf.org\n- figure out, after validation, if I can compile OBNC for working on\n  Artemis and Oberon-07 code projects\n\nUpdates\n-------\n\n7:30 - 7:30; Gopher; Setup; Account verified, Yippee!\n",
