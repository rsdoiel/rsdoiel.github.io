What worked for\nme was to first install cargo via the instructions in the [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). \n\n~~~shell\ncurl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\n~~~\n\nAn important note is if you previously installed a version of Cargo/Rust\nvia the debian package system you should uninstall it before running the\ninstructions above from the Cargo Book.\n\nWith this version I was able to install __ncgopher__ using the simple\nrecipe of \n\n~~~shell\ncargo install ncgopher\n~~~\n\n\n",
