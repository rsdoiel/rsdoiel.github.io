Doiel, 2020-07-08\n\nUPDATE (2020-08-15, RSD): When I added a post today I was VERY pleased to \nto see that GitHub now allows me to publish my blog via the \"main\" branch.\nIt's nice to see the change in the words we use.\n\n**Why does software development use the vocabulary of slavery and\nJim Crow to describe our creations?** What we call things matters.\nThis is especially true of the words we use day to day without thinking.\n\n```shell\n    git pull origin master\n```\n\n\"Naming things is a hard problem in computer science.\" That is\na phrase I remember from my student days. We name variables,\nprograms and algorithms. We name architectures. Naming is a choice.\nThe names convey meaning and intent. Names and terms are a human\ncommunication. They matter.\n\n```shell\n    git push origin master\n```\n\n\n## Names can change\n\nI remember the first time I encountered the terminology \"master/slave\"\ndescribing network and database architecture. I remember cringing at\nthe terms. I accepted the terminology because I was a student and\nnaively assumed that those terms were chosen innocently and did not\nmean what they did. I was wrong.\n\nExample MySQL command:\n\n```sql\n    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST=host1,\n    MASTER_PORT=3002 FOR CHANNEL 'channel2';\n```\n\nWhen I did not challenge the use of those terms in computer science\nI became complicit in the status quo of systemic racism. I am not happy\nabout that. Not then and not now.  We need inclusive language\nin engineering. We need real diversity to find solutions to\ntoday's challenges.  In software engineering we very much control what\nwe call things. Software is an explicit form of written human\ncommunication. Words count. Words directly impact culture and our\ncommunity.\n\nExample MySQL commands:\n\n```sql\n    START SLAVE;\n    RESET SLAVE;\n    STOP SLAVE;\n```\n\nAs a direct benefactor of white male privilege I find the\nterminology of \"master/slave\" offensive.  I am certain those\nwords caused injury to those who did not benefit from the same white\nmale privilege.  Using \"master/slave\" terminology to describe database,\nreplication, network architectures or as used with version control\nsystems like Git is like polishing statues that glorify slavery.\nIt endorses inhumanity in a subtle and casual way.\n\nWe have a choice about how we communicate and what we communicate\nto convey meaning.  Let's use better words. It is time to change\nsome.\n\n\n## Practice Change\n\n**To change our community's vocabulary we need to thoughtfully choose terms**.\nMy friends and colleagues introduced me to using the term \"main\" as\na better descriptive word than \"master\" in Git repositories. When\nI started making the branch name changes in my Git repositories I ran\nacross a problem at GitHub.\n\n\n## Note the problem\n\nRecently GitHub made it possible to easily change the default branch.\nFor a number of years you could change the published documentation\nbranch from \"gh-pages\" to something you prefer.\nWhat you can't do is change the name of the branch used to publish\npersonal and group websites.  **GitHub explicitly states that the\npublication branch must be named \"master\".** I tested this and\nconfirmed the documentation is accurate as of today (2020-07-08, morning).\n\nWith the recent improvements in GitHub to allow default branches to\nbe named better it seems odd that you still have to publish\npersonal and group pages to \"master\" in order to publish a website. It\nnever made sense to me that person and group pages didn't use the default\nof \"gh-pages\" in the first place.\n\n\n## Taking action\n\nMorning (2020-07-08): I submitted a ticket to GitHub asking to have\nthe option of using another word besides \"master\" for the publication\nbranch in publishing my personal GitHub pages (i.e. this blog).\nUnfortunately the ticket doesn't have a public URL. I don't know how many\nother people have submitted similar requests. If only a few people\nhave requested this recently it will not be changed. Such is the nature\nof systemic problems.\n\nPlease help improve the words and names we use in software.\nI believe it can make a difference in creating a more inclusive and\nequitable community and profession. Raise the issue when it comes to\nyour attention. Silence becomes acceptance with systemic problems.\n\n## A reply\n\nEvening (2020-07-08): I got a reply today from Steve G of customer\nsupport. Not sure if the reply is a bot or human.  It was a nice polite\nreply (I wrote a nice polite ticket).  Steve mentioned that CEO Nat\nFriedman had addressed this on twitter and to follow the GitHub blog\nnews.  Steve said dropping master was a priority for GitHub but there\nis no time line for implementation.\n\nI am not sure how you can develop software with a priority in mind and\nnot have a sense of time it takes to implement it.  I mentioned that in my\nresponse to Steve G.\n\nAfter some Duck Duck searching I found a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955) dated June 15th, 2020 where Nat made the\nannouncement about Microsoft's GitHub making the change away from \"master\".\nNext week is July 15th. It will be interesting to see how much of an unscheduled priority this change is.\n\nI am skeptical.  If Steve G had indicated that they are actively working\nthe problem and provided a general time range I would be more inclined to\ngive Nat, GitHub and Microsoft the benefit of the doubt.  Given the rest\nof the content I read on Nat's twitter feed I don't think this is a priority\nbeyond press, publicity and stock price.\n\n\n## Where to go from here?\n\nJust as many sites have adopted more gender neutral terms in documentation\npractice we should encourage better descriptive terms for our algorithms,\nand architectures. If you run into terms perpetuating exclusion please\nspeak up.  Most of the web runs on web servers and databases.  Like GitHub\nthose software projects frequently use the terminology of \"master/slave\".\nIt is especially prevalent in documentation about replication. Blindly\nperpetuating the \"master/slave\" terminology to describe distributed\nsoftware and architectures is like polishing a statue to the old\nConfederacy. It can and should be change. We can communicate better\nwithout perpetuating the vocabulary of Jim Crow, segregation, slavery\nand oppression.\n\n",
