Doiel, 2020-07-07\n\nThis is the tenth post in the [Mostly Oberon](../../04/11/Mostly-Oberon.html) series.\nMostly Oberon documents my exploration of the Oberon Language, Oberon System and the \nvarious rabbit holes I will inevitably fall into.\n\nIn my last post I looked at how Oberon-07 supports the passing of procedures as parameters in a procedure. In this one I am looking at how we can\ninclude procedures as a part of an Oberon RECORD. \n\nLet's modify our module name [Noises.Mod](Noises.Mod) to explore this.\nCopy \"Noises.Mod\" to \"Creatures.Mod\". Replace the \"MODULE Noises;\" line with\n\"MODULE Creatures;\" and the final \"END Noises.\" statement with \"END Creatures.\".\n\n\n~~~\n\n    MODULE Creatures;\n    \n    (* rest of code here *)\n\n    END Creatures.\n\n~~~\n\n\nThe key to supporting records with procedures as record attributes is once again Oberon's type system.  The type `Noise` we created in the previous post can also be used to declare a record attribute similar to how we use this new type to pass the procedure. In this exploration will create a linked list of \"Creature\" types which include a \"MakeNoise\" attribute.\n\nFirst let's define our \"Creature\" as a type as well as a \n`CreatureList`. Add the following under our `TYPE` \ndefinition in [Creatures.Mod](Creatures.Mod).\n\n\n~~~\n\n    Creature = POINTER TO CreatureDesc;\n    CreatureDesc = RECORD\n                     name : ARRAY 32 OF CHAR;\n                     noises : Noises;\n                   END;\n\n~~~\n\n\nLet's create a new `MakeCreature` procedure that will create\na populate a single `Creature` type record.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    PROCEDURE MakeCreature(name : ARRAY OF CHAR; noise : Noise; VAR creature : Creature);\n    BEGIN\n      NEW(creature);\n      creature.name := name;\n      creature.noise := noise;\n    END MakeCreature;\n\n~~~\n\n\nNow lets modify `MakeNoise` to accept the `Creature` type RECORD\nrather than a name and a noise procedure parameter.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    PROCEDURE MakeNoise(creature : Creator);\n    BEGIN\n      creature.noise(creature.name);\n    END MakeNoise;\n\n~~~\n\n\nHow does this all work?  The two \"Noise\" procedures \n\"BarkBark\" and \"ChirpChirp\" remain as in our original \n\"Noises\" module. But our new `MakeNoise` procedure\nlooks takes a `Creature` record rather than accepting a\nname and procedure as parameters. This makes the code \na little more concise as well as lets you evolve the\ncreature record type using an object oriented approach.\n\nOur revised module should look like this.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    MODULE Noises;\n      IMPORT Out;\n    \n    TYPE \n      Noise = PROCEDURE(who : ARRAY OF CHAR);\n\n      Creature = RECORD\n                   name : ARRAY 32 OF CHAR;\n                   noises : Noises;\n                 END;\n    \n    VAR\n      dog, bird : Creature;\n\n    PROCEDURE BarkBark(who : ARRAY OF CHAR);\n    BEGIN\n      Out.String(who);\n      Out.String(\": Bark, bark\");Out.Ln();\n    END BarkBark;\n    \n    PROCEDURE ChirpChirp(who : ARRAY OF CHAR);\n    BEGIN\n      Out.String(who);\n      Out.String(\": Chirp, chirp\");Out.Ln();\n    END ChirpChirp;\n    \n    PROCEDURE MakeNoise(creature : Creature);\n    BEGIN\n      (* Call noise with the animal name *)\n      creature.noise(creature.name);\n    END MakeNoise;\n\n    PROCEDURE MakeCreature(name : ARRAY OF CHAR; noise : Noise; VAR creature : Creature);\n    BEGIN\n      NEW(creature);\n      creature.name := name;\n      creature.noise := noise;\n    END MakeCreaturel\n    \n    BEGIN\n      MakeCreature(\"Fido\", BarkBark, dog);\n      MakeCreature(\"Tweety\", ChirpChirp, bird);\n      MakeNoise(dog);\n      MakeNoise(bird);\n    END Noises.\n\n~~~\n\n\nWhere to go from here? Think about evolving [Creatures](Creatures.Mod) so\nthat you can create a dynamic set of creatures that mix and match their\nbehaviors. Another idea would be to add a \"MutateCreature\" procedure\nthat would let you change the noise procedure to something new.\n\n\n### Next and Previous \n\n+ Next [Portable Oberon-07](../../08/15/Portable-Oberon-07.html)\n+ Previous [Procedures as parameters](../../06/20/Procedures-as-parameters.html) \n\n\n",
