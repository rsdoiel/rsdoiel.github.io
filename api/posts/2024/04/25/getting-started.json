Haskell was used for programs I use almost daily such as [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/). I've given a quick review of [miranda.org.uk](https://miranda.org.uk) to get a sense of the language but to follow along with the [Miranda: The Craft of Functional Programming](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/Miranda_craft/) it is really helpful to have Miranda available on my machine. Today that machine is a Mac Mini, M1 processor, running macOS Sonoma (14.4.x) and the related Xcode C tool chain.  I ran into to minor hiccups in compilation and installation. Both easy to overcome but ones I will surely forget in the future. Thus I write myself another blog post.\n\n## Compilation\n\nFirst down load Miranda source code at <http://miranda.org.uk/downloads>. The version 2.066 is the most recent release I saw linked (2024-04-25), <http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/ccount/click.php?id=11>. The [COPYING](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/downloads/COPYING) link shows the terms under which this source release is made available.\n\nNext you need to untar/gzip the tarball you downloaded. Try running `make` to see if it compiles. On my Mac Mini I got a compile error that looks like\n\n~~~shell\nmake\ngcc -w    -c -o data.o data.c\ndata.c:666:43: error: incompatible integer to pointer conversion passing 'word' (aka 'long') to parameter of type 'char *' [-Wint-conversion]\n                     else fprintf(f,\"%c%s\",HERE_X,mkrel(hd[x]));\n                                                        ^~~~~\n1 error generated.\nmake: *** [data.o] Error 1\n~~~\n\nWhile I'm rusty on C I read this as the C compiler being more strict today then it was back in the 1990s. That's a good thing generally.  Next I checked the compiler version. \n\n~~~shell\ngcc --version\nApple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)\nTarget: arm64-apple-darwin23.4.0\nThread model: posix\nInstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin\n~~~\n\nI'm using clang and the website mentioned it should compile with clang for other platforms.  I reviewed the data.c file and notice other similar lines that invoked `mkrel(hd[x])` had a `(char *)` cast in front of `hd[x]`. This tells me that being explicit with the compiler might solve my problem. I edited line 666 of data.c to look like\n\n~~~C\n    else fprintf(f,\"%c%s\",HERE_X,mkrel((char *)hd[x]));\n~~~\n\nSave the file and then ran Make again. It compile cleanly. I gave at quick test run of the `mira` command creating an simple function called `addone`\n\n~~~miranda\nmira\n/edit\naddone a = a + 1\n:wq\naddone (addone (addone 3))\n6\n/q\n~~~\n\nMiranda seems to work. The Makefile comes with a an install rule but the install defaults doesn't really work with macOS (it wants to install into `/usr`).\nI'd rather it install into my home directory so I copied the Makefile to `miranda.mak` and change the lines setting `BIN`, `LIB` and `MAN` to the following\nlines.\n\n~~~Makefile\nBIN=$(HOME)/bin\nLIB=$(HOME)/lib#beware no spaces after LIB\nMAN=$(HOME)/man/man1\n~~~\n\nIn my `.profile` I set the `MIRALIB` variable to point at `$HOME/lib/miralib`. I opened a new terminal session and ran `mira` and the interpreter was up and running.\n\n\n",
