Doiel, 2024-01-04\n\nThese are my updated \"quick notes\" for compiling PostgREST v12.0.2 on a M1 Mac Mini using the current recommended\nversions of ghc, cabal and stack supplied [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup).  When I recently tried to use\nmy previous [quick recipe](/blog/2023/07/05/quick-recipe-compiling-PostgREST-M1.md) I was disappointed it failed with errors like \n\n~~~\nResolving dependencies...\nError: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:\n[__0] trying: postgrest-9.0.1 (user goal)\n[__1] next goal: optparse-applicative (dependency of postgrest)\n[__1] rejecting: optparse-applicative-0.18.1.0 (conflict: postgrest =>\noptparse-applicative>=0.13 && <0.17)\n[__1] skipping: optparse-applicative-0.17.1.0, optparse-applicative-0.17.0.0\n(has the same characteristics that caused the previous version to fail:\nexcluded by constraint '>=0.13 && <0.17' from 'postgrest')\n[__1] trying: optparse-applicative-0.16.1.0\n[__2] next goal: directory (dependency of postgrest)\n[__2] rejecting: directory-1.3.7.1/installed-1.3.7.1 (conflict: postgrest =>\nbase>=4.9 && <4.16, directory => base==4.17.2.1/installed-4.17.2.1)\n[__2] trying: directory-1.3.8.2\n[__3] next goal: base (dependency of postgrest)\n[__3] rejecting: base-4.17.2.1/installed-4.17.2.1 (conflict: postgrest =>\nbase>=4.9 && <4.16)\n\n...\n\n~~~\n\nSo this type of output means GHC and Cabal are not finding the versions of things they need\nto compile PostgREST. I then tried picking ghc 9.2.8 since the default.nix file indicated\na minimum of ghc 9.2.4.  The `ghcup tui` makes it easy to grab a listed version then set it\nas the active one.\n\nI made sure I was working in the v12.0.2 tagged release version of the Git repo for PostgREST.\nThen ran the usual suspects for compiling the project. I really wish PostgREST came with \ninstall from source documentation. It took me a while to think about looking in the default.nix\nfile for a minimum GHC version. That's why I am writing this update.\n\nA similar recipe can be used for building PostgREST on Linux.\n\n1. Upgrade [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) to get a good Haskell setup (I accept all the default choices)\n    a. Use the curl example command to install it or `gchup upgrade`\n    b. Make sure the environment is active (e.g. source `$HOME/.ghcup/env`)\n2. Make sure GHCup is pointing at the version PostgREST v12.0.2 needs, i.e. ghc v9.2.8. I chose to keep \"recommended\" versions of Cabal and Stack\n3. Clone <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest> to my local machine\n4. Check out the version you want to build, i.e. v12.0.2\n5. Run the \"usual\" Haskell build sequence with cabal\n    a. `cabal clean`\n    b. `cabal update`\n    c. `cabal build`\n    d. `cabal install` (I use the `--overwrite-policy=always` option to overwrite my old v11 postgrest install)\n\nHere's an example of the shell commands I run (I'm assuming you're installing GHCup for the first time).\n\n~~~\nghcup upgrade\nghcup tui\nmkdir -p src/github.com/PostgREST\ncd src/github.com/PostgREST\ngit clone git@github.com:PostgREST/postgrest\ncd postgrest\ngit checkout v12.0.2\ncabal clean\ncabal update\ncabal build\ncabal install --overwrite-policy=always\n~~~\n\nThis will install PostgREST in your `$HOME/.cabal/bin` directory. Make sure\nit is in your path (it should be if you've sourced the GHCup environment after you installed GHCup).\n\n\n",
