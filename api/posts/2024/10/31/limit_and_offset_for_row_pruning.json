  "content": "\n# Limit and offset for row pruning\n\nBy R. S. Doiel, 2024-10-31\n\nI recently needed to prune data that tracked report requests and their processing status. The SQLite3 database table is called\n\"reports\" and has four columns.\n\n- `id` (uuid)\n- `created` (request date stamp)\n- `updated` (status updated date stamp)\n- `src` (a JSON column with the status details)\n\nThe problem is the generated report can be requested as needed. I wanted to maintain the request data for the most recent one. The \"src\" column has the report name and status. That is easily checked using the JSON notation supported by SQLite3 (v3.47.0). It's easy to get the most recent completed row with a simple SELECT statement using both an ORDER clause and LIMIT clause.\n\n~~~sql\nselect id\n  from reports\n  where src->>'report_name' = 'myreport' and\n        src->>'status' = 'completed'\n  order by updated desc\n  limit 1\n~~~\n\nThis gives me the key to the most recent record.  How do I get a list of he rows I want to prune?  The answer is to use the LIMIT cause with an OFFSET\nmodifier. The OFFSET let's us skip a certain number of rows before applying the limit.  In this case I want to skip one row and show the rest. This database table doesn't get that big so I can use a limit like one thousand. Here's what that looks like.\n\n~~~sql\nselect id\n  from reports\n  where src->>'report_name' = 'myreport' and\n        src->>'status' = 'completed'\n  order by updated desc\n  limit 1000 offset 1\n~~~\n\nNow that I have my list of ids I can combine it with a DELETE statement which has a WHERE clause. The WHERE clause will use the IN operator to iterate over the list of ids from my select statement.\n\nPutting it all together it looks like this.\n\n~~~sql\ndelete from reports\n  where id in (\n    select id\n      from reports\n      where src->>'report_name' = 'myreport' and\n            src->>'status' = 'completed'\n      order by updated desc\n      limit 1000 offset 1\n)\n~~~\n\nThe nice thing is I can run this regularly. It will never delete the most recent row because the offset value is one.\n\n",
