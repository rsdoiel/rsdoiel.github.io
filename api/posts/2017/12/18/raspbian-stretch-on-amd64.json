It has a nice keyboard and reasonable \nscreen size and resolution. I bought it as a writing machine. I mostly\nwrite in Markdown or Fountain depending on what I am writing these days.\n\n## Getting the laptop setup\n\nThe machine came with a minimal bootable Windows 7 CD and an blank \ninternal drive. Windows 7 installed fine but was missing the network \ndrivers for WiFi.  I had previously copied the new [Raspbian Stretch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspbian-stretch/) ISO to a USB drive. While\nthe E4310 didn't support booting from the USB drive Windows 7 does make\nit easy to write to a DVRW. After digging around and finding a blank disc\nI could write to it was a couple of mouse clicks and a bit of waiting \nand I had new bootable Raspbian Stretch CD.\n\nBooting from the Raspbian Stretch CD worked like a charm. I selected \nthe graphical install which worked well though initially the trackpad \nwasn't visible so I just used keyboard navigation to setup the install.\nAfter the installation was complete and I rebooted without the install\ndisc everything worked except the internal WiFi adapter.\n\nI had several WiFi dongles that I use with my Raspberry Pis so I \nborrowed one and with that was able to run the usual `sudo apt update \n&& sudo apt upgrade`.\n\nWhile waiting for the updates I did a little web searching and found \nwhat I needed to know on the Debian Wiki (see\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/iwlwifi?action=show&redirect=iwlagn).  Following\nthe instructions for *Debian 9 \"Stretch\"* ---\n\n```shell\n    sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/non-free.list \n    # adding the deb source line from the web page\n    sudo apt update && sudo apt install fireware-iwlwifi\n    sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi; sudo modprobe iwlwifi\n    sudo shutdown -r now\n```\n\nAfter that everything came up fine.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nFirst, I like Raspbian Pixel. It was fun on my Pi but on an Intel box\nwith 4Gig RAM it is wicked fast.  Pixel is currently my favorite flavor \nof Debian GNU/Linux. It is simple, minimal with a consistent UI for \nan X based system. Quite lovely. \n\nIf you've got an old laptop you'd like to breath some life into \nRaspbian Stretch is the way to go.\n\n\n### steps for my install process\n\n+ Booted from a minimal Windows 7 CD to get a basic OS minus networking\n+ Used Windows 7 and the internal DVD-RW to create a Raspbian Stretch CD\n+ Booted from the Raspbian Stretch CD and installed Raspbian replacing Windows 7\n+ Used a spare WiFi dongle initially to fetch the non-free iwlwifi modules\n+ Updated my source list, re-run apt update and upgrade\n+ Rebooted and everything came up and is running\n\n",
