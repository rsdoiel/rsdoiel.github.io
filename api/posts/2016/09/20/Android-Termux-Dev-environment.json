I started wondering if I could use it as a development device when on the road. So this is my diary of that test.\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. Find a way to run Bash without rooting my device\n2. See if I could use my normal web toolkit\n\t+ curl\n\t+ jq\n\t+ sed\n\t+ grep\n3. See if I could compile or add my own custom Golang programs\n4. Test setup by running a local static file server, mkpage and update my website\n\n## Searching for Android packages and tools of my toolbox\n\nAfter searching with Duck Duck Go and Google I came across the [termux](https://termux.com). Termux provides a minimal Bash shell environment with support for adding\npackages with _apt_ and _dpkg_.  The repositories visible to *termux* include\nmost of the C tool chain (e.g. clang, make, autoconf, etc) as well as my old Unix favorites _curl_, _grep_, _sed_, _gawk_ and a new addition to my toolkit _jq_.  Additionally you'll find recent versions (as of Sept. 2016) versions of _Golang_, _PHP_, _python_, and _Ruby_.\n\nThis quickly brought me through step 3.  Installing _go_, _git_, and _openssh_ completed what I needed to test static site development with some of the tools in our incubator at [Caltech Library](https://caltechlibrary.github.io).\n\n## Setting up for static site development\n\nAfter configuring _git_, adding my public key to GitHub and running _go get_ on my\ncustom static site tools I confirmed I could build and test static websites from my Android tablet using *Termux*.\n\nHere's the list of packages I installed under *Termux* to provide a suitable shell environment for writing and website constructions.\n\n```shell\n    apt install autoconf automake bash-completion bc binutils-dev bison \\\n        bzip2 clang cmake coreutils ctags curl dialog diffutils dos2unix \\\n        expect ffmpeg findutils gawk git gnutls golang grep gzip \\\n\timagemagick jq less lynx m4 make-dev man-dev nano nodejs \\\n        openssh patch php-dev python readline-dev rlwrap rsync ruby-dev \\\n        sed sensible-utils sharutils sqlite tar texinfo tree unzip vim \\\n        w3m wget zip\n```\n\nThis then allowed me to setup my *golang* environment variables and install\nmy typical custom written tools\n\n```shell\n    export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH\n    export GOPATH=$HOME\n    export GOBIN=$HOME/bin\n    go get github.com/rsdoiel/shelltools/...\n    go get github.com/caltechlibrary/mkpage/...\n    go get github.com/caltechlibrary/md2slides/...\n    go get github.com/caltechlibrary/ws/...\n```\n\nFinally pulled down some content to test.\n\n```shell\n    cd\n    mkdir Sites\n    git clone https://github.com/rsdoiel/rsdoiel.github.io.git Sites/rsdoiel.github.io\n    cd  Sites/rsdoiel.github.io\n    ws\n```\n\nThis started the local static site webserver and I pointed by Firefox for Android at http://localhost:8000 and saw a local copy of my personal website. From there I wrote this article and updated it just as if I was working on a Raspberry Pi or standard Linux laptop.\n\n\n",
