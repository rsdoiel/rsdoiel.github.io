I like the idea but found I didn't use it much due to a preference for\nbasic Raspbian. With the recent Pi-TopOS upgrades I realized getting back to basic Raspbian was relatively\nstraight forward.\n\n## The recipe\n\n1. Make sure you're running the latest Pi-TopOS based on Jessie\n2. Login into your Pi-Top normally\n3. From the Pi-Top dashboard select the \"Desktop\" icon\n4. When you see the familiar Raspbian desktop click on the following things\n\t+ Click on the Raspberry Menu (upper left corner)\n\t+ Click on Preferences\n\t+ Click on Raspberry Pi Configuration\n5. I made the following changes to my System configuration\n\t+ Under *Boot* I selected \"To CLI\"\n\t+ I unchecked *login as user \"pi\"*\n6. Restart your Pi Top\n\t+ Click on Raspberry Menu in the upper left of the desktop\n\t+ Click on shutdown\n\t+ Select *reboot*\n7. When you restart you'll see an old school console login, login as the pi user using your Pi-Top password\n8. Remove the following program use the *apt* command\n\t+ ceed-universe\n\t+ pt-dashboard\n\t+ pt-splashscreen\n\n```\n    sudo apt purge ceed-universe pt-dashboard pt-splashscreen\n```\n\nNote: pi-battery, pt-hub-controller, pt-ipc, pt-speaker are hardware drivers specific to your Pi-Top so you probably\nwant to keep them.\n\n\n\n",
