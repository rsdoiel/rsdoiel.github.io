      "content": "\nRosette Notes\n=============\n\nBy R. S. Doiel, 2022-08-19\n\n> A dance around two relational databases, piecing together similarities as with the tiny mosaic tiles of a guitar's rosette\n\nWhat follows are my preliminary notes learning Postgres 12 and 14.\n\nPostgres & MySQL\n----------------\n\nThis is a short comparison of some administrative commands I commonly use. The first column describes the task followed by the SQL to execute for Postgres 14.5 and then MySQL 8. The presumption is you're using `psql` to access Postgres and `mysql` to  access MySQL. Values between `<` and `>` should be replaced with an appropriate value.\n\n| Task                    | Postgres 14.5                     | MySQL 8           |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| show all databases      | `SELECT datname FROM pg_database;` | `SHOW DATABASES;` |\n| select a database       | `\\c <dbname>`                      | `USE <dbname>`    |\n| show tables in database | `\\dt`                              | `SHOW TABLES;`    |\n| show columns in table   | `SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = '<table_name>';` | `SHOW COLUMNS IN <table_name>` |\n\nReflections\n-----------\n\nThe Postgres shell, `psql`, provides the functionality of showing a list of tables via a short cut while MySQL choose to add the `SHOW TABLES` query. For me `SHOW ...` feels like SQL where as `\\d` or `\\dt` takes me out of SQL space. On the other hand given Postgres metadata structure the shortcut is appreciated and I often query for table names as I forget them. `\\dt` quickly becomes second nature and is shorter to type than `SHOW TABLES`. \n\nConnecting to a database with `\\c` in `psql` is like calling an \"open\" in programming language. The \"connection\" in `psql` is open until explicitly closed or the shell is terminated.  Like `USE ...` in the MySQL shell it make working with multiple database easy.  The difference are apparent when you execute a `DROP DATABASE ...` command. In `psql` you need to `CLOSE` the database first or the `DROP` will fail.  The MySQL shell will happily let you drop the current database you are currently using.\n\nThe challenge I've experienced learning `psql` after knowing MySQL is my lack of familiarity with the metadata Postgres maintains about databases and structures.  On the other hand everything I've learned about standards base SQL applies to managing Postgres once remember the database/table I need to work with.  A steeper learning curve from MySQL's `SHOW` but it also means writing external programs for managing Postgres databases and tables is far easier because everything is visible because that is how you manage Postgres. MySQL's `SHOW` is very convenient but at the cost of hiding some of its internal structures.\n\nBoth MySQL and Postgres support writing programs in SQL. They also support stored procedures, views and triggers. They've converged in the degree in which they have both implemented SQL language standards.  The differences are mostly in approach to managing databases.  There are some differences, necessitated by implementation choices, in the `CREATE DATABASE`, `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER` statements but you can often use the basic form described in ANSI SQL and get the results you need. When doing performance tuning the dialect differences are more important.\n\nDump & Restore\n--------------\n\nBoth Postgres and MySQL provide command line programs for dumping a database. MySQL provides a single program where as Postgres splits it in two. Check the man pages (or website docs) for details in their options. Both sets of programs are highly configurable allowing you to dump just schema, just data or both with different expectations.\n\n| Postgres 14.5      | MySQL 8                         |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------|\n| `pg_dumpall`       | `mysqldump --all-databases`     |\n| `pg_dump <dbname>` | `mysqldump --database <dbname>` |\n\nThe `pg_dumpall` tool is designed to restore an entire database instance. It includes account and ownership information. `pg_dump` just focuses on the database itself. If you are taking a snapshot production data to use in a test `pg_dump` output is easier to work with. It captures the specific database with out entangling things like the `template1` database or database user accounts and ownership.\n\nYou can restore a database dump in both Postgres and MySQL. The tooling is a little different.\n\n| Postgres 14.5                   | MySQL 8                                      |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| `dropdb <dbname>`               | `mysql -execute 'DROP DATABASE <dbname>;'`   |\n| `createdb <dbname>`             | `mysql -execute 'CREATE DATABASE <dbname>;'` |\n| `psql -f <dump_filename>`       |`mysql <dbname> < <dump_filename>`            |\n\nNOTE: These instructions work for a database dumped with `pg_dump` for the Postgres example. In principle it is the same way you can restore from `pg_dumpall` but if you Postgres instance already exists then you're going to run into various problems, e.g. errors about `template1` db.\n\nLessons learned along the way\n-----------------------------\n\n2022-08-22\n\n8:00 - 11:30; SQL; Postgres; Three things have turned out to be challenges in the SQL I write, first back ticks is a MySQL-ism for literal quoting of table and column names, causes problems in Postgres.

Doiel, started 2022-08-15\n(updated: 2022-09-26, pdtk was renamed pttk)\n\nThis log is a proof of concept in using [simple timesheet notation](https://rsdoiel.github.io/stngo/docs/stn.html) as a source for very short blog posts. The tooling is written in Golang (though eventually I hope to port it to Oberon-07).  The implementation combines two of my personal projects, [stngo](https://github.com/rsdoiel/stngo) and my experimental writing tool [pttk](https://github.com/rsdoiel/pttk). Updating the __pttk__ cli I added a function to the \"blogit\" action that will translates the simple timesheet notation (aka STN) to a short blog post.  My \"short post\" interest is a response to my limited writing time. What follows is the STN markup. See the [Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsdoiel/rsdoiel.github.io/main/blog/2022/08/15/golang-development.md) source for the unprocessed text.\n\n2022-08-15\n\n16:45 - 17:45; Golang; ptdk, stngo; Thinking through what a \"post\" from an simple timesheet notation file should look like. One thing occurred to me is that the entry's \"end\" time is the publication date, not the start time. That way the post is based on when it was completed not when it was started. There is an edge case of where two entries end at the same time on the same date. The calculated filename will collide. In the `BlogSTN()` function I could check for potential file collision and either issue a warning or append. Not sure of the right action. Since I write sequentially this might not be a big problem, not sure yet. Still playing with formatting before I add this type of post to my blog. Still not settled on the title question but I need something to link to from my blog's homepage and that \"title\" is what I use for other posts. Maybe I should just use a command line option to provide a title?\n\n2022-08-14\n\n14:00 - 17:00; Golang; pdtk, stngo; Today I started an experiment. I cleaned up stngo a little today, still need to implement a general `Parse()` method that works on a `io.Reader`. After a few initial false starts I realized the \"right\" place for rendering simple timesheet notation as blog posts is in the the \"blogit\" action of [pdtk](https://rsdoiel.github.io/pttk). I think this form might be useful for both release notes in projects as well as a series aggregated from single paragraphs. The limitation of the single paragraph used in simple timesheet notation is intriguing. Proof of concept is working in v0.0.3 of pdtk. Still sorting out if I need a title and if so what it should be.\n\n2022-08-12\n\n16:00 - 16:30; Golang; stngo; A work slack exchange has perked my interest in using [simple timesheet notation](https://rsdoiel.github.io/stngo/docs/stn.html) for very short blog posts. This could be similar to Dave Winer title less posts on [scripting](http://scripting.com). How would this actually map? Should it be a tool in the [stngo](https://rsdoiel.githubio/stngo) project?\n\n2022-09-26\n\n6:30 - 7:30; Golang; pttk; renamed \"pandoc toolkit\" (pdtk) to \"plain text toolkit\" (pttk) after adding gopher support to cli.

Mostly Oberon documents my exploration of the Oberon\nLanguage, Oberon System and the various rabbit holes I will\ninevitably fall into.\n\nIn my day job I write allot of code in Go and\norchestration code in Python.  It's nice having\nthe convenience of combining code written one\nlanguage with an another.  You can do the same\nwith [OBNC](https://miasap.se/obnc/).  The OBNC\ncompiler supports inclusion of C code in a\nstraight forward manner. In fact Karl's compiler\nwill generate the C file for you!\n\nIn learning how to combine C code and Oberon-07\nI started by reviewing Karl's [manual page](https://miasap.se/obnc/man/obnc.txt).\nThe bottom part of that manual page describes\nthe steps I will repeat below. The description\nsounds more complicated but when you walk through\nthe steps it turns out to be pretty easy.\n\n## Basic Process\n\nCreating a C extension for use with OBNC is very\nstraight forward.\n\n1. Create a Oberon module with empty exported procedures\n2. Create a Oberon test module that uses your module\n3. Compile your test module with OBNC\n4. Copy the generated module `.c` file to the same directory as your Oberon module source\n5. Edit the skeleton `.c`,  re-compile and test\n\nFive steps may sound complicated but in practice is\nstraight forward.\n\n## Fmt, an example\n\nIn my demonstration of Karl's instructions I will be\ncreating a module named `Fmt` that includes two\nprocedures `Int()` and `Real()` that let you use\na C-style format string to format an INTEGER\nor REAL as an ARRAY OF CHAR. We retain the idiomatic\nway Oberon works with types but allow a little more\nflexibility in how the numbers are converted and\nrendered as strings.\n\n### Step 1\n\nCreate [Fmt.Mod](Fmt.Mod) defining two exported procedures\n`Int*()` and `Real*()`. The procedures body should be\nempty. Karl's practice is to use exported comments to\nexplain the procedures.\n\n\n~~~ {.oberon}\n\n    MODULE Fmt;\n\n    \tPROCEDURE Int*(value : INTEGER; fmt: ARRAY OF CHAR;\n                       VAR dest : ARRAY OF CHAR);\n    \tEND Int;\n\n    \tPROCEDURE Real*(value : REAL; fmt: ARRAY OF CHAR;\n                        VAR dest : ARRAY OF CHAR);\n    \tEND Real;\n\n    BEGIN\n    END Fmt.\n\n~~~\n\n\n### Step 2\n\nCreate a test module, [FmtTest.Mod](FmtTest.Mod), for\n[Fmt.Mod](Fmt.Mod).\n\n\n~~~ {.oberon}\n\n    MODULE FmtTest;\n      IMPORT Out, Fmt;\n\n    PROCEDURE TestInt(): BOOLEAN;\n      VAR\n        fmtString : ARRAY 24 OF CHAR;\n        dest : ARRAY 128 OF CHAR;\n        i : INTEGER;\n    BEGIN\n        i := 42;\n        fmtString := \"%d\";\n        Fmt.Int(i, fmtString, dest);\n        Out.String(dest);Out.Ln;\n        RETURN TRUE\n    END TestInt;\n\n    PROCEDURE TestReal(): BOOLEAN;\n      VAR\n        fmtString : ARRAY 24 OF CHAR;\n        dest : ARRAY 128 OF CHAR;\n        r : REAL;\n    BEGIN\n        r := 3.145;\n        fmtString := \"%d\";\n        Fmt.Real(r, fmtString, dest);\n        Out.String(dest);Out.Ln;\n        RETURN TRUE\n    END TestReal;\n\n    BEGIN\n      ASSERT(TestInt());\n      ASSERT(TestReal());\n      Out.String(\"Success!\");Out.Ln;\n    END FmtTest.\n\n~~~\n\n\n### Step 3\n\nGenerate a new [Fmt.c](Fmt.c) by using the\nOBNC compiler.\n\n\n~~~ {.shell}\n\n    obnc FmtTest.Mod\n    mv .obnc/Fmt.c ./\n\n~~~\n\n\nthe file `.obnc/Fmt.c` is your C template file. Copy it\nto the directory where Fmt.Mod is.\n\n### Step 4\n\nUpdate the skeleton `Fmt.c` with the necessary C code.\nHere's what OBNC generated version.\n\n\n~~~ {.c}\n\n    /*GENERATED BY OBNC 0.16.1*/\n\n    #include \"Fmt.h\"\n    #include <obnc/OBNC.h>\n\n    #define OBERON_SOURCE_FILENAME \"Fmt.Mod\"\n\n    void Fmt__Int_(OBNC_INTEGER value_, const char fmt_[], \n                   OBNC_INTEGER fmt_len, char dest_[], \n                   OBNC_INTEGER dest_len)\n    {\n    }\n\n\n    void Fmt__Real_(OBNC_REAL value_, const char fmt_[],\n                    OBNC_INTEGER fmt_len, char dest_[],\n                    OBNC_INTEGER dest_len)\n    {\n    }\n\n\n    void Fmt__Init(void)\n    {\n    }\n\n~~~\n\n\nHere's the skeleton revised with do what we need to be done.\n\n\n~~~ {.c}\n\n    #include \".obnc/Fmt.h\"\n    #include <obnc/OBNC.h>\n    #include <stdio.h>\n\n    #define OBERON_SOURCE_FILENAME \"Fmt.Mod\"\n\n    void Fmt__Int_(OBNC_INTEGER value_, \n                   const char fmt_[], OBNC_INTEGER fmt_len,\n                   char dest_[], OBNC_INTEGER dest_len)\n    {\n        sprintf(dest_, fmt_, value_);\n    }\n\n\n    void Fmt__Real_(OBNC_REAL value_, const char fmt_[],\n                    OBNC_INTEGER fmt_len, char dest_[],\n                    OBNC_INTEGER dest_len)\n    {\n        sprintf(dest_, fmt_, value_);\n    }\n\n\n    void Fmt__Init(void)\n    {\n    }\n\n~~~\n\n\nNOTE: You need to change the path for the `Fmt.h` file reference.\nI also add the `stdio.h` include so I have access to the C\nfunction I wish to use.

Mostly Oberon documents my exploration of the Oberon Language, \nOberon System and the various rabbit holes I will inevitably fall into.\n\n## Dynamic Types in Oberon\n\nOberon-07 is a succinct systems language. It provides a minimal\nbut useful set of basic static types. Relying on them addresses \nmany common programming needs. The Oberon compiler ensures \nstatic types are efficiently allocated in memory. One of the \nstrengths of Oberon is this ability to extend the type system. \nThis means when the basic types fall short you can take \nadvantage of Oberon's type  extension features. This includes \ncreating dynamically allocated data structures. In Oberon-07 \ncombining Oberon's `POINTER TO` and `RECORD` types allows us to\ncreate complex and dynamic data structures. \n\n\n## An example, dynamic strings \n\nStrings in Oberon-07 are typical declared as an `ARRAY OF CHAR` \nwith a specific length. If the length of a string is not \nknown a head of time this presents a challenge. One approach is \nto declare a long array but that would allocate allot of memory \nwhich may not get used. Another approach is to create a dynamic\ndata structure. An example is using a linked list of shorter \n`ARRAY OF CHAR`.  The small fixed strings can combine to \nrepresent much larger strings. When one fills up we add \nanother. \n\n### Pointers and records, an Oberon idiom \n\nOur data model is a pointer to a record where the record \ncontains an `ARRAY OF CHAR` and a pointer to the next record. \nA common idiom in Oberon for dynamic types is to declare a \n`POINTER TO` type and declare a `RECORD` type which contains\nthe `POINTER TO` type as an attribute.  If you see this idiom \nyou are looking at some sort of dynamic data structure. The \npointer type is usually named for the dynamic type you want \nwork with and the record type is declared using the same name \nwith a \"Desc\" suffix. In our case `DynamicString` will be the \nname of our `POINTER TO` type and our record type will be \ncalled `DynamicStringDesc` following the convention.  In our \nrecord structure we include a \"value\" to holding a short \nfixed length `ARRAY OF CHAR`  and a \"next\" to holding the \npointer to our next record.\n\nIn our record the value is declared as a static type. We need\nto know how long our \"short\" string should be? I.e. What length\nis our `ARRAY OF CHAR`? It's a question of tuning. If it is too \nshort we spend more time allocating new records, too long and \nwe are wasting memory in each record. A way to make tuning a \nlittle simpler is to use a constant value to describe our array \nlength. Then if we decide our array is too big \nor too small we can adjust the constant knowing that our record \nstructure and the procedures that use that the length \ninformation will continue to work correctly. \n\nLet's take a look at actual code (NOTE: vSize is our constant value). \n\n~~~\n\n    CONST\n      vSize = 128; \n    \n    TYPE\n      DynamicString* = POINTER TO DynamicStringDesc;\n      DynamicStringDesc* = RECORD \n        value : ARRAY vSize OF CHAR; \n        next : DymamicString; \n      END;\n\n~~~\n\nNOTE: Both `DynamicString` and `DynamicStringDesc` are defined \nusing an `*`. These are public and will be available \nto other modules.  Inside our record `DynamicStringDesc` we \nhave two private to our module attributes, `.value` and \n`.next`. They are private so that we can change our \nimplementation in the future without requiring changes in \nmodules that use our dynamic strings. Likewise our constant `vSize`\nis private as that is an internal implementation detail. This\npractice is called information hiding.\n\nNOTE: The asterisk in Oberon decorates procedures, types, variables\nand constants that are \"public\" to other modules.\n\nNOTE: Variables are always exported read only.\n\nNOTE: With information hiding some details of implementation allow us \nto keep a clean division between implementation inside the module and how\nthat implementation might be used. With out information hiding we often\nhave \"leaky\" abstractions that become brittle and hard to maintain and\nrely on.\n\n\n\n## Working with DynamicString\n\nOur type definitions describe to the compiler how to layout our \ndata in memory. The type system in Oberon-07 also ensures that \naccess to that memory is restricted to assignments, operations \nand procedures compatible with that type. To be useful from \nother modules we need a few procedures to help work with\nthis new data type. What follows is a minimal set needed to be \nuseful.\n\n### `New*(VAR str : DynamicString)`\n\n`New` will initialize a DynamicString object setting `.value` to \nan empty string. \n\n\n~~~\n\n  PROCEDURE New*(VAR str : DynamicString);\n  BEGIN NEW(str);\n    str.value := \"\"; \n    str.next := NIL;\n  END New;\n\n~~~\n\n\n### `Set*(VAR str : DynamicString; source : ARRAY OF CHAR)` \n\n`Set` copies an `ARRAY OF CHAR` into an existing DynamicString. \nThis requires that we add and link additional records if the \n`source` is longer than our current dynamic string. Set is a \nbridge procedure between an existing datatype, `ARRAY OF CHAR` \nand our new data type, `DynamicString`.\n\n\n~~~\n\n  PROCEDURE Set*(VAR str : DynamicString; source : ARRAY OF CHAR); \n    VAR cur, next : DynamicString; tmp : ARRAY vSize OF CHAR; \n        i, l : INTEGER;\n  BEGIN cur := str; cur.value := \"\";\n    l := Strings.Length(source);\n    i := 0; \n    WHILE i < l DO\n      Strings.Extract(source, i, i + vSize, tmp);\n      Strings.Append(tmp, cur.value);\n      i := i + Strings.Length(tmp);\n      IF (i < l) THEN\n        IF cur.next = NIL THEN\n          New(next); cur.next := next;\n        END;\n        cur := cur.next;\n      END; \n    END;\n  END Set;\n\n~~~\n\n### `ToCharArray*(str : DynamicString; VAR dest : ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR ok : BOOLEAN)`\n\n`ToCharArray` copies the contents of our dynamic string into an array \nof char setting `ok` to TRUE on success or FALSE if truncated. \nLike `Set*` it is a bridge procedure to let us move data output \nour new dynamic string type.\n\n\n~~~\n\n  PROCEDURE ToCharArray*(str : DynamicString; \n                         VAR dest : ARRAY OF CHAR; \n                         VAR ok : BOOLEAN);\n    VAR cur : DynamicString; i : INTEGER;\n  BEGIN \n    ok := FALSE;\n    cur := str; i := 0;\n    WHILE cur # NIL DO\n      i := i + Strings.Length(cur.value);\n      Strings.Append(cur.value, dest);\n      cur := cur.next;\n    END;\n    ok := (i = Strings.Length(dest));\n  END ToCharArray;\n\n~~~\n\nTwo additional procedures will likely be needed-- `Append` and \n`AppendCharArray`. This first one is trivial, if we want to add \none dynamic string onto another all we need to do is link the \nlast record of the first and point it to a copy of the second string we're appending.\n\n\n### `Append*(extra : DynamicString; VAR dest : DynamicString);`\n\n`Append` adds the `extra` dynamic string to `dest` dynamic string. Our \n\"input\" is `extra` and our output is a modified dynamic string \nnamed `dest`. This parameter order mimics the standard \n`Strings` module's `Append`.\n\nNOTE: Oberon idiom is often input values, modified value and \nresult values. Modified and result values are declared in the parameter\ndefinition using `VAR`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n1. Move to the end of `dest` dynamic string\n2. Create a new record at `cur.next`.\n3. Copy `extra.value` info.value `cur.next.value`\n4. Advance `extra` and `cur`, repeating steps 2 to 4 as needed.\n\nImplemented procedure.\n\n~~~\n\n  PROCEDURE Append*(extra: DynamicString; VAR dest : DynamicString);\n    VAR cur : DynamicString;  \n  BEGIN\n    (* Move to the end of the dest DynamicString *)\n    cur := dest;\n    WHILE cur.next # NIL DO cur := cur.next; END;\n    (* Starting initial pointer of `extra` copy its records\n       input new records created in `cur`. *)\n    WHILE extra # NIL DO\n      (* Create a new record *)\n      NEW(cur.next);\n      cur.next.value := \"\";\n      cur.next.next := NIL;\n      (* Copy extra.value into new record *)\n      Strings.Extract(extra.value, 0, vSize, cur.next.value);\n      (* Advance to next record for both cur and extra *)\n      extra := extra.next;\n      cur := cur.next;\n    END;\n  END Append;\n\n~~~\n\nA second procedure for appending an `ARRAY OF CHAR` also \nbecomes trivial. First convert the `ARRAY OF CHAR` to a dynamic \nstring then append it with the previous procedure.\n\n### `AppendCharArray*(src : ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR str : DynamicString);`\n\nThis procedure appends an ARRAY OF CHAR to an existing dynamic string.\n\n~~~\n\n  PROCEDURE AppendCharArray*(extra: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR dest : DynamicString);\n    VAR extraStr : DynamicString;    \n  BEGIN\n    (* Convert our extra ARRAY OF CHAR into a DynamicString *)\n    New(extraStr); Set(extraStr, extra);\n    (* Now we can append. *)\n    Append(extraStr, dest);\n  END AppendCharArray;\n\n~~~\n\nAt some point we will want to know the length of our dynamic string.\n\n### `Length(str : DynamicString) : INTEGER`\n\nOur `Length` needs to go through our linked list and total up \nthe length of each value. We will use a variable called `cur` \nto point at the current record and add up our total length as \nwe walk through the list.\n\n~~~\n\n  PROCEDURE Length*( source : DynamicString) : INTEGER;\n    VAR cur : DynamicString; total : INTEGER;\n  BEGIN\n    total := 0;\n    cur := source;\n    WHILE cur # NIL DO\n      total := total + Strings.Length(cur.value);\n      cur := cur.next;\n    END; \n    RETURN total\n  END Length;\n\n~~~\n\n## Extending DynamicStrings module\n\nWith these few procedures we have a basic means of working with \ndynamic strings. Moving beyond this we can look at the standard \nOberon `Strings` module for inspiration.  If we use similar \nprocedure signatures we can create a drop in replacement \nfor `Strings` with `DynamicStrings`.\n\nNOTE: Procedure signatures refer to procedures type along \nwith the order and types of parameters. A quick review of the \nprocedure signatures for the standard module [Strings](https://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/Strings.def.html) is \nprovided by the [OBNC](https://miasap.se/obnc) compiler docs. \n\nLet's look at recreating `Insert` as a potential guide to\na more fully featured [\"DynamicStrings.Mod\"](DynamicStrings.Mod). \nIn our `Insert` we modify the procedure signature so the \nsource and destinations are dynamic strings.\n\n\n### `Insert(source : DynamicString; pos : INTEGER; VAR dest : DynamicString)`\n\nThe `Insert` procedure inserts a `source` dynamic string at the \nposition provided into our `dest` dynamic string. We are implementing\nthe same signature  for our `DynamicStrings.Insert()` as \n`Strings.Insert()`. Only the parameters for source and destination\nare changed to `DynamicString`.\n\nInternally our procedure for `Insert` is a more complicated than\nthe ones we've written so far. It needs to do all the housing \nkeeping for making sure we add the right content in the correct\nspot.  The general idea is to find the record holding the split \npoint. Split that record into two records. The first retains \nthe characters before the insert position. The second holds the \ncharacters after the insert position and points to next record \nin the dynamic string. Once the split is accomplished it then \nis a matter of linking everything up. The record before the \ninsert position is set to point at the dynamic string to be \ninserted, the inserted dynamic string is set to point at the \nrecord that contained the rest of the characters after the \nsplit.\n\nIt is easy to extract a sub-string from an `ARRAY OF CHAR` \nusing the standard `Strings` module.  We can store the characters\nin the `.value` of the record after the split in a temporary \n`ARRAY OF CHAR`.  The temporary `ARRAY OF CHAR` can be used to \ncreate a new dynamic string record which will be linked to the \nrest of our destination dynamic string. The record which held \nthe characters before the insert position needs to be truncated \nand it needs to be linked to the dynamic string we want to \ninsert. NOTE: This will leave a small amount of unused \nmemory.\n\nNOTE: If conserving memory is critical then re-packing the \ndynamic string could be implemented as another procedure. The \ncost would be complexity and time to shift characters between \nlater records and earlier ones replacing excess NULL values.\n\nWe need to find the record where the split will occur. In the \nrecord to be split we need to calculate a relative \nsplit point. We then can copy the excess characters in that \nsplit record to a new record and truncate the `.value`'s \n`ARRAY OF CHAR` to create our split point. Truncating is easy \nin that we replace the CHAR in the `.values` that are not \nneeded with a NULL character. We can do that with a \nsimple loop. Likewise calculating the relative insertion \nposition can be done by taking the modulo of the `vSize` of \n`.value`.\n\nNOTE: In Oberon stings are terminated with a NULL \ncharacter. A NULL character holds the ASCII value `0X`.\n\nOur algorithm:\n\n1. Set `cur` to point to the start of our destination dynamic string\n2. Move `cur` to the record in the link list where the insertion will take place\n3. Calculate the relative split point in `cur.value`\n4. Copy the characters in `cur.value` from relative split point to end of `.value` into a temporary `ARRAY OF CHAR`\n5. Make a new record, `rest`, using the temporary `ARRAY OF CHAR` and update the value of `.next` to match that of `cur.next`\n6. Truncate the record (cur) at the relative split point\n7. Set `cur.next` to point to our `extra` dynamic string.\n8. Move to the end of extra with `cur`\n9. Set the `cur.next` to point at `rest`\n\nOur procedure:\n\n~~~\n\n  PROCEDURE Insert*(extra : DynamicString; \n                    pos : INTEGER; \n                    VAR dest : DynamicString);\n    VAR cur, rest : DynamicString;\n        tmp : ARRAY vSize OF CHAR;\n        i, splitPos : INTEGER; continue : BOOLEAN;\n  BEGIN\n    (* 1. Set `cur` to the start of our `dest` dynamic string *)\n    cur := dest;\n\n    (* 2. Move to the record which holds the split point *)\n    i := 0;\n    continue := (i < pos);\n    WHILE continue DO\n      i := i + Strings.Length(cur.value);\n      continue := (i < pos);\n      IF continue & (cur.next # NIL) THEN\n        cur := cur.next;\n      ELSE\n        continue := FALSE;\n      END;\n    END;\n\n    (* 3. Copy the characters in `cur.value` from relative\n          split point to end of `.value` into a \n          temporary `ARRAY OF CHAR` *)\n    splitPos := pos MOD vSize;\n    Strings.Extract(cur.value, splitPos,\n                    Strings.Length(cur.value), tmp);\n\n    (* 4. Make a new record, `rest`, using the temporary \n          `ARRAY OF CHAR` and update the value of `.next` to\n          match that of `cur.next` *)\n    New(rest); Set(rest, tmp);\n    rest.next := cur.next;\n\n    (* 5. Truncate `cur.value` at the relative split point *)\n    i := splitPos;\n    WHILE i < LEN(cur.value) DO\n      cur.value[i] := 0X;\n      INC(i);\n    END;\n\n    (* 6. Set `cur.next` to point to our `extra`\n          dynamic string. *)\n    cur.next := extra;\n\n    (* 7. Move to the end of extra with `cur` *)\n    WHILE cur.next # NIL DO cur := cur.next; END;\n\n    (* 8. Set the `cur.next` to point at `rest` *)\n    cur.next := rest;\n  END Insert;\n\n~~~\n\nWhile our `Insert` is the longest procedure so far the steps \nare mostly simple. Additionally we can easily extend this to \nsupport inserting a more traditional `ARRAY OF CHAR` using our\npreviously established design pattern of converting a basic type\ninto our dynamic type before calling the dynamic version of the\nfunction.\n\n~~~\n\n  PROCEDURE InsertCharArray*(source : ARRAY OF CHAR; \n                             pos : INTEGER; \n                             VAR dest : DynamicString);\n    VAR extra : DynamicString;\n  BEGIN\n    New(extra); Set(extra, source);\n    Insert(extra, pos, dest);\n  END InsertCharArray;\n\n~~~\n\n## Where to go next\n\nIt is possible to extend our \"DynamicStrings.Mod\" into a drop \nin replacement for the standard `Strings`.  I've included a \nskeleton of that module as links at the end of this article \nwith stubs for the missing implementations such as `Extract`, \n`Replace`, `Pos`, and `Cap`.  I've also included a \n\"DynamicStringsTest.Mod\" for demonstrating how it works.\n\nThe procedure I suggest is to mirror `Strings` replacing the \nparameters that are `ARRAY OF CHAR` with `DynamicString`. It \nwill be helpful to include some bridging procedures that accept \n`ARRAY OF CHAR` as inputs too. These will use similar names \nwith a suffix of `CharArray`.\n\n## Parameter conventions and order\n\nOberon is highly composable. The trick to creating a drop in \nreplacement module is use the same parameter signatures so \nyou only need to make minor changes like updating the `IMPORT` \nstatement and using a module alias to map the old module to the\nnew one.  The parameter signatures in `Strings` follow a \nconvention you'll see in other Oberon modules. The parameter\norder is based on the \"inputs\", \"modify parameters\", and \n\"output parameters\". Inputs are non-`VAR` parameters. The \nremaining are `VAR` parameters. I think of \"modify parameters\" \nas those objects who reflect side effects. I think of \"output\" \nas values that in other languages would be returned by \nfunctions.  This is only a convention. A variation I've \nread in other Oberon modules is \"object\", \"inputs\", \"outputs\". \n\"object\" and \"outputs\" are `VAR` parameters and \"inputs\" are \nnot. This ordering makes sense when we think of records as \nholding an object. In both cases ordering is a convention \nand not enforced by the language.  Convention and consistency is \nhelpful but readability is the most important.  Oberon is a \nreadable language. It does not reward obfuscation. Readability is \na great virtue in a programming language. When creating your own \nmodules choose readability based on the concepts you want to\nemphasize in the module (e.g. procedural, object oriented).\n\n## The modules so far\n\nYou can read the full source for the module discussed along\nwith a test module in the links that follow.\n\n+ [DynamicStrings.Mod](DynamicStrings.Mod)\n+ [DynamicStringsTest.Mod](DynamicStringsTest.Mod)\n\n\n### Next and Previous \n\n+ Next [Procedures as parameters](../../06/20/Procedures-as-parameters.html)\n+ Previous [Oberon-07 and the file system](../09/Oberon-07-and-the-filesystem.html) \n",

Mostly Oberon documents my exploration of the Oberon Language, Oberon System and the various rabbit holes I will inevitably fall into.\n\n## Working with files in Oberon-07\n\nIn a POSIX system we often talk of opening files,\nwriting and reading files and close files. The Oberon\nlanguage reflects a more Oberon System point of view.\n\nThe Oberon System generally avoids modality in favor\nof action. Modality is where a context must be set\nbefore a set of actions are possible. The `vi` \ntext editor is a \"modal\" editor. You are in either\nedit (typing) mode or command mode. At the function\nlevel POSIX's `open()`, is also modal. You can \nopen a file for reading, open a file for writing,\nyou can open a file for appending, etc. The Oberon\nlanguage and base modules avoids modality.\n\nThe Oberon System is highly interactive but\nhas a very different idea about code, data and computer\nresources. In POSIX the basic unit of code is a program\nand the basic unit of execution is a program. In Oberon\nthe basic unit of code is the module and the basic unit\nof execution is the procedure.  Modules are brought into \nmemory and persist. As a result it is common in \nthe Oberon System to need to have file representations \nthat can persist across procedure calls. It provides\na set of abstractions that are a little bit like views\nand cursors found in database systems. In taking\nthis approach Oberon language eschews modality at the\nprocedure level. \n\nNOTE: Modules can be explicitly unload otherwise they persist until the computer is turned off\n\n## Key Oberon Concepts\n\nThe following are exported in the `Files` module.\n\nFile\n: is a handle to the representation of a file, a File and Rider form a view into a file.\n\nRider\n: similar to a database cursor, it is the mechanism that lets you navigate in a file\n\nNew\n: Creates a new file (in memory but not on disc).\n\nRegistration\n: Associates a file handle created with New with the file system. A file must be registered to persist in the file system.\n\nOld\n: Opens an existing file for use.\n\nSet\n: Set the position of a rider in a file\n\nPos\n: Gets the position of a rider in a file\n\nClose\n: Writes out unwritten buffers in file to disc, file handle is still value as is the rider.\n\nPurge\n: Sets a file's length to zero.\n\nDelete\n: Unregister the filename with the file system.\n\nIn the Oberon Systems a file can be \"opened\" many\ntimes with only one copy maintained in memory. This allows\nefficient operations across a module's procedures.\nLikewise a file can have one or more Riders associated with\nit. Each rider can move through the file independently operating on\nthe common in memory file. If a file is created with `New` but\nnot registered it can be treated like an in-memory temp file.\nClosing a file writes its buffers but the file remains accessible\nthrough it handle and riders. If a file is not modified it\ndoesn't need to be closed.\n\nIn POSIX we generally want to explicitly close the file when\nwe're through. In the Oberon language we only need to close\na file if we've modified it.\n\nThe behavior of files and riders in Oberon creates interesting\nnuances around deleting files.  The Delete operation can in\nprinciple happen multiple times before the file is deleted on\ndisc.  That is because the file handles and riders may still\nbe operating on it.  To know when a file is finally deleted \nwhen `Delete` procedure is called it includes a results\nparameter. When that value is set to zero by the `Delete`\nprocedure you know your file has been deleted.\n\nThe `Files` module provides a number of methods\nto read and write basic Oberon types. These use the rider\nrather than the file handle. Calling them automatically\nupdates the riders position. The procedures themselves\nmap to what we've seen in the modules `In` and `Out`.  \nThere are a few additional commands for file system house \nkeeping such as `Length`, `GetDate`, `Base`.\nSee the OBNC documentation for the `Files` module for\ndetails <https://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/Files.def.html>.\n\nIn the following examples we'll be using the `Files`\nmodule to create, update and delete a file called \n`HelloWorld.txt`.\n\n### Creating a file\n\nThe recipe we want to follow for creating a file is\nNew (creates an empty file in memory), Register\n(associations the filename with the file system), \nSet the rider position, with the rider write our\ncontent and with the file call close because we've\nhave changed the file.\n\nLike our origin `SayingHi` we'll demonstrate this code\nin a new module called `TypingHi.Mod`. Below is\na procedure called `WriteHelloWorld`. It shows how\nto create, write and close the new file called\n\"HelloWorld.txt\".\n\n\n~~~\n\n  PROCEDURE WriteHelloWorld;\n    VAR\n      (* Define a file handle *)\n      f : Files.File;\n      (* Define a file rider *)\n      r : Files.Rider;\n  BEGIN\n    (* Create our file, New returns a file handle *)\n    f := Files.New(\"HelloWorld.txt\");\n    (* Register our file with the file system *)\n    Files.Register(f);\n    (* Set the position of the rider to the beginning *)\n    Files.Set(r, f, 0);\n    (* Use the rider to write out \"Hello World!\" *)\n    Files.WriteString(r, \"Hello World!\");\n    (* Write a end of line *)\n    Files.Write(r, 10);\n    (* Close our modified file *)\n    Files.Close(f);\n  END WriteHelloWorld;\n\n~~~\n\n\n#### Receipt in review\n\n+ New, creates our file\n+ Register, associates the file handle with the file system \n+ Set initializes the rider's position\n+ WriteString, writes our \"Hello World!\" to the file\n+ Close, closes the file, flushing unwritten content to disc\n\n\n### Working with an existing file\n\nIf we're working with an existing file we swap `New` for \na procedure named `Old`.

It pointed out a problem in this implementation of Hello World.  I had incorrectly coded the end of line with `Files.WriteString(r, 0AX);` this is wrong.  At best it should have been `Files.Write(r, 10);`. There remains an issues with `Files.WriteString(\"Hello World!\");`. The Oakwood module `Files` defines \"WriteString\" to include the trailing NULL character. This will be output in the file. It all depends on how close to the Oakwood specification that your compiler implements the `Files` module.\n\n\n\n### Next and Previous\n\n+ Next [Dynamic Types](../25/Dynamic-types.html)\n+ Previous [Compiling OBNC on macOS](../06/Compiling-OBNC-on-macOS.html)\n\n",

      "content": "\nCompiling OBNC on macOS \n=======================\n\nBy R. S. Doiel, 2020-05-06\n\nThis is the sixth post in the [Mostly Oberon](../../04/11/Mostly-Oberon.html) series. Mostly Oberon documents my exploration of the Oberon Language, Oberon System and the various rabbit holes I will inevitably fall into.\n\nCompiling OBNC v0.16.1 on macOS (10.13.6) using MacPorts (2.6.2) \nis straight forward if you have the required dependencies and \nenvironment setup up. Below are my notes to get everything working.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n+ OBNC v0.16.1\n+ SDL v1.2\n+ Boehm-Demers-Weiser GC\n+ A C compiler and linker (OBNC uses this to generate machine specific code)\n\n### SDL 1.2\n\nMacPorts has libsdl 1.2 available as a package called \"libsdl\"\n(not surprisingly). There are other versions of the SDL available\nin ports but this is the one we're using.\n\n\n~~~\n\n   sudo port install libsdl\n\n~~~\n\n\n### The Boehm-Demers-Weiser GC\n\nYou need to install the Boehm-Demers-Weiser GC installed. Using\nMacPorts it is almost as easy as installing under Debian. The\npackage is less obviously named than under Debian. The package\nyou want is \"beohmgc\".\n\n\n~~~\n\n    sudo port install boehmgc\n\n~~~\n\n\nMore info on the GC.\n\n+ [The Boehm-Demers-Weiser GC](https://www.hboehm.info/gc/)\n+ [MacPorts page](https://ports.macports.org/port/boehmgc/summary)\n\n### C compiler and linker\n\nXCode is provides a C compiler and linker. That is what is installed on my\nmachine. It can be a bit of a pain at times with obscure errors, particularly with regards to the linker. Your milleage may very. I know you can\ninstall other C compilers (e.g. Clang) but I haven't tried them yet.\n\n## Setting up my environment\n\nYou need to update your CC variables to find the header and\nshared library files for compilation of obnc with `build`. (I added\nthese to my `.bash_profile`). New Macs ships with zsh and\nyour settings might be in a different location. MacPorts puts \nits libraries under the `/opt/local` directory.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=\"/usr/include:/usr/local/include:/opt/local/include\"\n    export LIBRARY_PATH=\"/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/opt/local/lib\"\n    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/opt/local/lib\"\n\n~~~\n\n\n## OBNC environment variables\n\nThis follows' Karl's docs.  Additionally if you install OBNC extlib so\nyou can do POSIX shell programs you'll need to set your\n`OBNC_IMPORT_PATH` environment.  An example of including a default\ninstall location and local home directory location.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    export OBNC_IMPORT_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/obnc:$HOME/lib/obnc\"\n\n~~~\n\n\n### Next and Previous\n\n+ Next [Oberon-07 and the file system](../09/Oberon-07-and-the-filesystem.html)\n+ Previous [Combining Oberon-07 and C](../01/Combining-Oberon-and-C.html)\n\n",

S. Doiel, 2020-08-15 (updated: 2020-09-05)\n\nKarl Landström's [OBNC](https://miasap.se/obnc/), Oberon-07 compiler,\ncomes with an Oberon-2 inspired set of modules\ndescribed in the Oakwood Guidelines as well as\nseveral very useful additions making Oberon-07 suitable for\nwriting programs in a POSIX environment.  We're going to\nexplore three of the Oakwood modules and two of Karl's own additions\nin this post as we create a program called [SlowCat](SlowCat.Mod).\nI am using the term \"portable\" to mean the code can be compiled\nusing OBNC on macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi OS and Windows 10\n(i.e. wherever OBNC is available). The Oakwood Guideline modules\nfocus on portability between an Oberon System and other systems.\nI'll leave that discussion along with\n[POW!](http://www.fim.uni-linz.ac.at/pow/pow.htm)\nto the end of this post.\n\n\n### SlowCat\n\nRecently while I was reviewing logs at work using [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)), [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep)\nand [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_(command)) it\nstruck me that it would have been nice if **cat**\nor **more** came with a time delay so you could use them like a\nteleprompter. This would let you casually watch the file scroll\nby while still being able to read the lines. The program we'll build\nin this post is \"SlowCat\" which accepts a command line parameter\nindicating the delay in seconds between display each line read from\nstandard input.\n\n## Working with Standard Input and Output\n\nThe Oakwood guides for Oberon-2 describe two modules\nparticularly useful for working with standard input and output.\nThey are appropriately called `In` and `Out`. On many Oberon Systems\nthese have been implemented such that your code could run under Unix\nor Oberon System with a simple re-compile.  We've used `Out` in our\nfirst program of this series, \"Hello World\". It provides a means to\nwrite Oberon system base types to standard out.  We've used `In`\na few times too. But `In` is worth diving into a bit more.\n\n### In\n\nThe [In](http://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/In.def.html) module provides\na mirror of inputs to those of [Out](http://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/Out.def.html). In Karl's implementation we are interested in one procedure\nand module status variable.\n\n+ `In.Line(VAR line: ARRAY OF CHAR)` : Read a sequence of characters from standard input from the current position in the file to the end of line.\n+ `In.Done` : Is a status Boolean variable, if the last call to an procedure in `In` was successful then it is set TRUE, otherwise FALSE (e.g. we're at the end of a file)\n\nWe use Karl's `In.Line()` extension to the standard `In` implementation\nbefore and will do so again as it simplifies our code and keeps things\neasily readable.\n\nThere is one nuance with `In.Done` that is easy to get tripped up on.\n`In.Done` indicates if the last operation was successful.\nSo if you're using `In.Line()` then `In.Done`\nshould be true if reading the line was successful. If you hit the end of\nthe file then `In.Done` should be false.  When you write your loop\nthis can be counter intuitive.  Here is a example of testing `In.Done`\nwith a repeat until loop.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    REPEAT\n      In.Line(text);\n      IF In.Done THEN\n        Out.String(text);Out.Ln();\n      END;\n    UNTIL In.Done = FALSE;\n\n~~~\n\n\nSo when you read this it is easy to think of `In.Done` as you're\ndone reading from standard input but actually we need to check for `FALSE`.\nThe value of `In.Done` was indicating the success of reading our line.\nAn unsuccessful line read, meaning we're at the end of the file, sets\n`In.Done` to false!\n\n### Out\n\nAs mention `Out` provides our output functions. We'll be using\ntwo procedure from `Out`, namely `Out.String()` and `Out.Ln()`.\nWe've seen both before.\n\n### Input\n\n\"SlowCat\" needs to calculate how often to write a line of\ntext to standard output with the `Out` module.  To do that\nI need access to the system's current time.  There isn't an\nOakwood module for time. There is a module called \n`Input` which provides a \"Time\" procedure. As a result\nI need to import `Input` as well as `In` even though\nI am using `In` to manage reading the file I am processing\nwith \"SlowCat\".\n\nA note about Karl's implementation.  `Input` is an Oakwood\nmodule that provides access to three system resources -- \nmouse, keyboard and system time.  Karl \nprovides two versions `Input` and `Input0`, the first is\nintended to be used with the `XYPlane` module for graphical\napplications the second for POSIX shell based application.\nIn the case of \"SlowCat\" I've stuck with `Input` as I am \nonly accessing time I've stuck with `Input` to make my source\ncode more portable if you're using another Oberon compiler.\n\n## Working with Karl's extensions\n\nThis is the part of my code which is not portable\nbetween compiler implementations and with Oberon Systems.\nKarl provides a number of extension module wrapping various\nPOSIX calls.  We are going to use two,\n[extArgs](http://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/ext/extArgs.def.html)\nwhich provides access to command line arguments and\n[extConvert](http://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/ext/extConvert.def.html)\nwhich provides a means of converting strings to integers.\nIf you are using another Oberon compiler you'll need to \nfind their equivalents and change my code example. I\nuse `extArgs` to access the command line parameters\nincluded in my POSIX shell invocation and I've used\n`extConvert` to convert the string presentation of the\ndelay to an integer value for my delay.\n\n\n## Our Approach\n\nTo create \"SlowCat\" we need four procedures and one\nglobal variable.\n\n`Usage()`\n: display a help text if parameters don't make sense\n\n`ProcessArgs()`\n: to get our delay time from the command line\n\n`Delay(count : INTEGER)`\n: a busy wait procedure\n\n`SlowCat(count : INTEGER)`\n: take standard input and display like a teleprompter\n\n`count`\n: is an integer holding our delay value (seconds of waiting) which is set by ProcessArgs()\n\n### Usage\n\nUsage just wraps helpful text and display it to standard out.\n\n## ProcessArgs()\n\nThis a functional procedure. It uses two of Karl's extension\nmodules. It uses `extArgs` to retrieve the command line parameters\nand `extConvert` the string value retrieved into an integer.\n`ProcessArgs()` returns TRUE if we can successful convert the\ncommand line parameter and set the value of count otherwise return\nFALSE.\n\n## Delay(VAR count : INTEGER)\n\nThis procedure uses `Input0` to fetch the current epoch time\nand counts the number of seconds until we've reached our delay\nvalue. It's a busy loop which isn't ideal but does keep the\nprogram simple.\n\n## SlowCat(VAR count: INTEGER);\n\nThis is the heart of our command line program. It reads\na line of text from standard input, if successful writes it\nto standard out and then waits using delay before repeating\nthis process. The delay is only invoked when a reading a\nline was successful.\n\n## Putting it all together\n\nHere's a \"SlowCat\" program.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    MODULE SlowCat;\n      IMPORT In, Out, Input, Args := extArgs, Convert := extConvert;\n\n    CONST\n      MAXLINE = 1024;\n\n    VAR\n      count: INTEGER;\n\n    PROCEDURE Usage();\n    BEGIN\n      Out.String(\"USAGE:\");Out.Ln();\n      Out.Ln();\n      Out.String(\"SlowCat outputs lines of text delayed by\");Out.Ln();\n      Out.String(\"a number of seconds. It takes one parameter,\");Out.Ln();\n      Out.String(\"an integer, which is the number of seconds to\");Out.Ln();\n      Out.String(\"delay a line of output.\");Out.Ln();\n      Out.String(\"SlowCat works on standard input and output.\");Out.Ln();\n      Out.Ln();\n      Out.String(\"EXAMPLE:\");\n      Out.Ln();\n      Out.String(\"    SlowCat 15 < README.md\");Out.Ln();\n      Out.Ln();\n    END Usage;\n\n    PROCEDURE ProcessArgs() : BOOLEAN;\n      VAR i : INTEGER; ok : BOOLEAN; arg : ARRAY MAXLINE OF CHAR;\n          res : BOOLEAN;\n    BEGIN\n      res := FALSE;\n      IF Args.count = 1 THEN\n        Args.Get(0, arg, i);\n        Convert.StringToInt(arg, i, ok);\n        IF ok THEN\n           (* convert seconds to microseconds of clock *)\n           count := (i * 1000);\n           res := TRUE;\n        END;\n      END;\n      RETURN res\n    END ProcessArgs;\n\n    PROCEDURE Delay*(count : INTEGER);\n      VAR start, current, delay : INTEGER;\n    BEGIN\n       start := Input.Time();\n       REPEAT\n         current := Input.Time();\n         delay := (current - start);\n       UNTIL delay >= count;\n    END Delay;\n\n    PROCEDURE SlowCat(count : INTEGER);\n      VAR text : ARRAY MAXLINE OF CHAR;\n    BEGIN\n      REPEAT\n        In.Line(text);\n        IF In.Done THEN\n          Out.String(text);Out.Ln();\n          (* Delay by count *)\n          Delay(count);\n        END;\n      UNTIL In.Done = FALSE;\n    END SlowCat;\n\n    BEGIN\n      count := 0;\n      IF ProcessArgs() THEN\n        SlowCat(count);\n      ELSE\n        Usage();\n      END;\n    END SlowCat.\n\n~~~\n\n\n## Compiling and trying it out\n\nTo compile our program and try it out reading\nour source code do the following.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    obnc SlowCat.Mod\n    # If successful\n    ./SlowCat 2 < SlowCat.Mod\n\n~~~\n\n\n\n## Oakwood Guidelines and POW!\n\nOberon and Oberon-2 were both used in creating and enhancing the\nOberon System(s) as well as for writing programs on other operating\nsystems (e.g. Apple's Mac and Microsoft Windows).\nImplementing Oberon compilers on non Oberon Systems required clarification\nbeyond the specification. The Oakwood Guidelines were an agreement\nbetween some of the important Oberon-2 compiler implementers which\nattempted to fill in that gap while encouraging portability in\nsource code between operating systems. Portability was desirable\nbecause it allowed programmers (e.g. students) to compile\nand run their Oberon programs with minimal modification in any\nenvironment where an Oakwood compliant compiler was available.\n\nCitation for Oakwood can be found in [Oberon-2 Programming with Windows](https://archive.org/details/oberonprogrammin00mhlb/page/n363/mode/2up?q=Oakwood+Guidlines).\n\n> Kirk B.(ed): The Oakwood Guidelines for Oberon-2 Compiler Developers. Available via FTP from ftp.fim.uni-linz.ac.at, /pub/soft/pow-oberon/oakwood\n\nThe FTP machine doesn't exist any more and does not appear to have been included in JKU's preservation plans. Fortunately the POW! website has been preserved.\n\n[POW!](http://www.fim.uni-linz.ac.at/pow/pow.htm) was a\ndifferent approach. It was a compiler and IDE targeting\nother than Oberon Systems (e.g. Windows and later Java). It was\nintended to be used in a hybrid development environment and to\nfacilitate leveraging non-Oberon resources (e.g. Java classes,\nnative Windows API).  POW project proposed \"Opal\" which was a\nsuper set of modules that went beyond Oakwood. Having skimmed\n\"Oberon-2 Programming with Windows\" some may seem reasonable to\nport to Oberon-07, others less so.\n\nWhy Oakwood and POW? These efforts are of interest to Oberon-07\ndevelopers as a well worn path to write code that is easy to\ncompile on POSIX systems and on systems that are based on the\nmore recent [Project Oberon 2013](http://www.projectoberon.com/).\nIt enhances the opportunity to bring forward well written modules\nfrom prior systems like [A2](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Oberon/A2)\nbut implemented for the next generation of Oberon Systems\nlike [Integrated Oberon](https://github.com/io-core/io).\n\n### Oakwood PDF\n\nFinding a PDF of the original Oakwood guidelines is going to become\ntricky in the future. It was created by Robinson Associates and the\ncopy I've read from 1995 includes a page saying not for distribution.\nWhich sorta makes sense in the era of closed source software\ndevelopment. It is problematic for those of us who want to explore\nhow systems evolved.  The term \"Oakwood Guidelines\" is bandied about\nafter 1993 and several of the modules have had influence on the language\nuse via book publications.  I was able to find a PDF of the 1995\nversion of the guidelines at\n[http://www.math.bas.bg/bantchev/place/oberon/oakwood-guidelines.pdf](http://www.math.bas.bg/bantchev/place/oberon/oakwood-guidelines.pdf).\n\nHere's a typical explanation of Oakwood from \n[http://www.edm2.com/index.php/The_Oakwood_Guidelines_for_Oberon-2_Compiler_Developers#The_Oakwood_Guidelines](http://www.edm2.com/index.php/The_Oakwood_Guidelines_for_Oberon-2_Compiler_Developers#The_Oakwood_Guidelines)\nfor a description of Oakwood.\n\n> __The Oakwood Guidelines for the Oberon-2 Compiler Developers /These guidelines have been produced by a group of Oberon-2 compiler developers, including ETH developers, after a meeting at the Oakwood Hotel in Croydon, UK in June 1993__\n\n[http://www.edm2.com/index.php/The_Oakwood_Guidelines_for_Oberon-2_Compiler_Developers#The_Oakwood_Guidelines](http://www.edm2.com/index.php/The_Oakwood_Guidelines_for_Oberon-2_Compiler_Developers#The_Oakwood_Guidelines)  \n(an OS/2 developer website) was helpful for providing details about Oakwood.\n\nIt would have been nice if the Oakwood document had made its way\ninto either ETH's or JKU's research libraries.\n\nLeveraging prior art opens doors to the past and future. Karl has\ndone with this with the modules he provides with his OBNC compiler\nproject.\n\n### Next and Previous\n\n+ Next [Oberon to Markdown](../../10/03/Oberon-to-markdown.html)\n+ Previous [Procedures in records](../..//07/07/Procedures-in-records.html)\n\n",

The community adopted the term from\nthe print world, \"front matter\". \n\nPandoc provides for several ways of working with metadata and supports\none format of front matter encoding called [YAML](https://yaml.org/). \nOther markup processors support other encoding of front matter. Two\npopular alternatives of encoding are [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) and \n[JSON](https://json.org).  If you use one of the alternative encoding\nfor your front matter then you'll need to split the front matter\nout of your document before processing with Pandoc[^1].  \n\n[^1]: The [MkPage Project](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/mkpage/) provides a tool called [frontmatter](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/mkpage/docs/frontmatter/) that can be easy or your can easily roll your own in Python or other favorite language.\n\n\nIf you provide YAML formatted front matter Pandoc will pass this\nmetadata on and make it available to it's template engine and the\ntemplates you create to render content with Pandoc. See the Pandoc\nUser Guide section [YAML metadata blocks](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block) for more details. If you've used another\nencoding of front matter then the metadata file approach is probably\nthe ticket.\n\nMetadata passed by command line\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you only have a metadata elements you would like to\nmake available to the template (e.g. title, pub date) you\ncan easily add them using the `--metadata` command line option.\nThis is documented in the Pandoc User Guide under the heading\n[Reader Options](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html). Here's a simple\nexample where we have a title, \"U. S. Constitution\" and a\npublication date of \"September 28, 1787\".\n\n~~~{.shell}\n    pandoc --metadata \\\n        title=\"U. S. Constitution\" \\\n        pubdate=\"September 28, 1787\" \\\n        --from markdown --to html --template doc1.tmpl \\\n        constitution.txt\n~~~\n\nThe template now has two additional values available as metadata\nin addition to `body`, namely `pubdate` and `title`. Here's an\nexample template [doc1.tmpl](doc1.tmpl).\n\n~~~\n\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html>\n   <head>\n       <title>${title}</title>\n   </head>\n   <body>\n      <h1>${title}</h1>\n      <h2>${pubdate}</h2>\n      <p>\n      ${body}\n      <p>\n   </body>\n   </html>\n\n~~~\n\nMore complex metadata is better suited to creating a JSON document\nwith the structure you need to render your template.\n\n\nMetadata file\n-------------\n\nMetadata files can be included with the option `--metadata-file`. This\nlike the `--metadata` option are discussed in the Pandoc User Guide under\nthe [Read Options(https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) heading.  The JSON \ndocument should contain an Object where each attribute corresponds to\nthe variable you wish to referenced in template.  Pandoc's template\nengine support both single values but also objects and arrays. In this\nway you can structure the elements you wish to include even elements\nwhich are iterative (e.g. a list of links or topics). Below is a\nJSON data structure that includes the page title as well as links\nfor the navigation.  The nav attribute holds a list of objects \nwith attributes of href and label containing data that will be used\nto render a list of anchor elements in the template.\n\n\n~~~{.json}\n\n    {\n        \"title\": \"U. S. Constitution\",\n        \"pubdate\": \"September 28, 1787\",\n        \"nav\": [\n            {\"label\": \"Pandoc Metadata\", \"href\": \"Pandoc-Metadata.html\" },\n            {\"label\": \"Magnacarta\", \"href\": \"magnacarta.html\" },\n            {\"label\": \"Declaration of Independence\", \"href\": \"independence.html\" },\n            {\"label\": \"U. S. Constitution\", \"href\": \"constitution.html\"}\n        ]\n    }\n\n~~~\n\nHere's a revised template to include the navigation,\nsee [doc2.tmpl](doc2.tmpl).\n\n~~~\n\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html>\n   <head>\n       <title>${title}</title>\n   </head>\n   <body>\n      <nav>\n      ${for(nav)}<a href=\"${nav.href}\">${nav.label}</a>${sep}, ${endfor}\n      </nav>\n      <h1>${title}</h1>\n      ${if(pubdate)}<h2>${pubdate}</h2>${endif}\n      <p>\n      ${body}\n      <p>\n   </body>\n   </html>\n\n~~~\n\n\nCombining Techniques\n--------------------\n\nIt is worth noting that these approaches can be mixed and matched.\nIn the following example I use the same [metadata.json](metadata.json)\nfile which has title and pubdate attributes but override them\nusing the command line `--metadata` option. In this way I can use that \nfile along with [doc2.tmpl](doc2.tmpl) and render each \nTo render the constitution page from a Markdown version of the \nU. S. Constitution you could use the following Pandoc command:\n\n~~~{.shell}\n\n\tpandoc --from markdown --to html --template doc2.tmpl \\\n        --metadata-file metadata.json \\\n        --metadata title=\"Magna Carta\" \\\n\t\t--metadata pubdate=\"1215\" \\\n\t\t-o magnacarta.html \\\n\t\tmagnacarta.txt\n\n\tpandoc --from markdown --to html --template doc2.tmpl \\\n        --metadata-file metadata.json \\\n        --metadata title=\"The Declaration of Indepenence\" \\\n\t\t--metadata pubdate=\"July 4, 1776\" \\\n        -o independence.html \\\n        independence.txt\n\n\tpandoc --from markdown --to html --template doc2.tmpl \\\n        --metadata-file metadata.json \\\n        --metadata title=\"U. S. Constitution\" \\\n\t\t--metadata pubdate=\"September 28, 1787\" \\\n        -o constitution.html \\\n        constitution.txt\n\n~~~\n\nSee [Magna Carta](magnacarta.html), [The Declaration of Independence](independence.html), [U.

Returns TRUE if everthing is ok, FALSE otherwise.\n\nIsValidTime\n: IsValidTime checks the hour, minute, second attributes of a DateTime record and validates the values. Returns TRUE if everthing is ok, FALSE otherwise.\n\nIsDateString\n: Checks to see if an ARRAY OF CHAR is a parsiable date string (e.g. in 2020-11-26 or 11/26/2020). Returns TRUE if the string is parsable, FALSE otherwise. NOTE: It does NOT check to see if the day, month or year values are valid. It only checks the format of the string.\n\nIsTimeString\n: Checks to see if an ARRAY OF CHAR is a parsible time string (e.g. 3:32, 14:55, 09:19:22).

Doiel, 2020-11-27\n\nThe [Oakwood](http://www.edm2.com/index.php/The_Oakwood_Guidelines_for_Oberon-2_Compiler_Developers#The_Oakwood_Guidelines)\nguidelines specified a common set of modules for Oberon-2 for writing\nprograms outside of an Oberon System. A missing module from the Oakwood\nguidelines is modules for working with dates and the system clock.\nFortunately the A2 Oberon System[^1] provides a template for that\nfunctionality. In this article I am exploring implementing the\n[Dates](Dates.Mod) and [Clock](Clock.Mod) modules for Oberon-07. I\nalso plan to go beyond the A2 implementations and provide additional\nfunctionality such as parsing procedures and the ability to work with\neither the date or time related attributes separately in the\n`Dates.DateTime` record.\n\n[^1]: A2 information can be found in the [Oberon wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Oberon#In_A2)\n\nDivergences\n-----------\n\nOne of the noticeable differences between Oberon-07 and Active Oberon\nis the types that functional procedures can return. We cannot return\nan Object in Oberon-07. This is not much of a handicap as we have\nvariable procedure parameters.  Likewise Active Oberon provides\na large variety of integer number types. In Oberon-07 we have only\nINTEGER. Where I've create new procedures I've used the Oberon idiom\nof read only input parameters followed by variable parameters with\nside effects and finally parameters for the target record or values\nto be updated.\n\n\nSimilarities\n------------\n\nIn spite of the divergence I have split the module into two.\nThe [Dates](Dates.html) module is the one you would include in your\nprogram, it provides a DateTime record type which holds the integer\nvalues for year, month, day, hour, minute and second. It provides the\nmeans of parsing a date or time string, comparison, difference and addition\nof dates.  The second module [Clock](Clock.html) provides a mechanism\nto retrieve the real time clock value from the host system and map the\nC based time object into our own DateTime record.  Clock is specific to\nOBNC method of interfacing to the C standard libraries of the host system.\nIf you were to use a different Oberon compiled such as the Oxford\nOberon Compiler you would need to re-implement Clock. Dates itself\nshould be system independent and work with Oberon-07 compilers generally.\n\nClock\n-----\n\nThe Clock module is built from a skeleton in Oberon-07 describing the\nsignatures of the procedure and an implementation in [C](Clock.c) that\nis built using the technique for discussed in my post\n[Combining Oberon-07 and C with OBNC](../../05/01/Combining-Oberon-and-C.html). In that article I outline Karl's three step process to create a\nmodule that will be an interface to C code.  In Step one I create\nthe Oberon module. Normally I'd leave all procedures empty and\ndevelop them in C. In this specific case I went ahead and wrote\nthe procedure called `Get` in Oberon and left the procedure `GetRtcTime`\nblank. This allowed OBNC to generate the C code for `Get` saving\nme some time and create the skeleton for `GetRtcTime` which does\nthe work interfacing with the system clock via C library calls.\n\nThe interface Oberon module looked like this:\n\n~~~{.oberon}\n\nMODULE Clock;\n\nPROCEDURE GetRtcTime*(VAR second, minute, hour, day, month, year : INTEGER);\nBEGIN\nEND GetRtcTime;\n\nPROCEDURE Get*(VAR time, date : INTEGER);\nVAR\n    second, minute, hour, day, month, year : INTEGER;\nBEGIN\n\tGetRtcTime(second, minute, hour, day, month, year);\n\ttime = ((hour * 4096) + (minute * 64)) + second;\n\tdate = ((year * 512) + (month * 32)) + day;\nEND Get;\n\nEND Clock.\n\n~~~\n\nI wrote the `Get` procedure code in Oberon-07 is the OBNC\ncompiler will render the Oberon as C during the\ncompilation process. I save myself writing some C code\nin by leveraging OBNC.\n\n\nStep two was to write [ClockTest.Mod](ClockTest.Mod) in Oberon-07.\n\n~~~{.oberon}\n\nMODULE ClockTest;\n\nIMPORT Tests, Chars, Clock; (* , Out; *)\n\nCONST\n    MAXSTR = Chars.MAXSTR;\n\nVAR\n    title : ARRAY MAXSTR OF CHAR;\n    success, errors : INTEGER;\n\nPROCEDURE TestGetRtcTime() : BOOLEAN;\nVAR second, minute, hour, day, month, year : INTEGER; \n    test, expected, result: BOOLEAN;\nBEGIN\n    test := TRUE;\n    second := 0; minute := 0; hour := 0;\n    day := 0; month := 0; year := 0;\n    expected := TRUE;\n    Clock.GetRtcTime(second, minute, hour, day, month, year);\n\n\n    result := (year > 1900);\n    Tests.ExpectedBool(expected, result, \n          \"year should be greater than 1900\", test);\n    result := (month >= 0) & (month <= 11);\n    Tests.ExpectedBool(expected, result,\n          \"month should be [0, 11]\", test);\n    result := (day >= 1) & (day <= 31);\n    Tests.ExpectedBool(expected, result,\n          \"day should be non-zero\", test);\n\n    result := (hour >= 0) & (hour <= 23);\n    Tests.ExpectedBool(expected, result,\n          \"hour should be [0, 23]\", test);\n    result := (minute >= 0) & (minute <= 59);\n    Tests.ExpectedBool(expected, result, \n          \"minute should be [0, 59]\", test);\n    result := (second >= 0) & (second <= 60);\n    Tests.ExpectedBool(expected, result,\n          \"second year should be [0,60]\", test);\n    RETURN test\nEND TestGetRtcTime;\n\nPROCEDURE TestGet() : BOOLEAN;\nVAR time, date : INTEGER; \n    test, expected, result : BOOLEAN;\nBEGIN\n    test := TRUE;\n    time := 0;\n    date := 0;\n    Clock.Get(time, date);\n    expected := TRUE;\n    result := (time > 0);\n    Tests.ExpectedBool(expected, result,\n        \"time should not be zero\", test);\n    result := (date > 0);\n    Tests.ExpectedBool(expected, result,\n        \"date should not be zero\", test);\n\n    RETURN test\nEND TestGet;\n\nBEGIN\n    Chars.Set(\"Clock module test\", title);\n    success := 0; errors := 0;\n    Tests.Test(TestGetRtcTime, success, errors);\n    Tests.Test(TestGet, success, errors);\n    Tests.Summarize(title, success, errors);\nEND ClockTest.\n\n~~~\n\nClockTest is a simple test module for [Clock.Mod](Clock.Mod).\nIt also serves the role when compiled with OBNC to create the\ntemplate C code for [Clock.c](Clock.c).

A little less obvious is Pandoc can be a template engine\nfor rendering static websites allowing you full control over the\nrendered content.\n\nThe main Pandoc documentation of the template engine can be found\nin the [User Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates).\nThe documentation is complete in terms of describing the template\ncapabilities but lacks a tutorial for using as a replacement for more\nambitious rendering systems like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or\n[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Pandoc takes a vary direct approach and\ncan be deceptively simple to implement.\n\nUse your own template\n---------------------\n\nFirst thing in this tutorial is to use our own template with Pandoc\nwhen rendering a single webpage. You use the `–-template` option to\nprovide your a template name. I think of this as the page level template.\nThis template, as I will show later, can then call other partial\ntemplates as needed.\n\nExample, render the [Pandoc-Partials.txt](Pandoc-Partials.txt) file using the\ntemplate named [index1.tmpl](index1.tmpl):\n\n~~~{.shell}\n\n    pandoc --from=markdown --to=html \\\n        --template=index1.tmpl Pandoc-Partials.txt > index1.htm\n\n~~~\n\nThis is a simple template page level template.\n\n~~~{.html-code}\n\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html>\n    <head>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n    ${body}\n    </body>\n    </html>\n\n~~~\n\nWhen we run our Pandoc command the file called\n[Pandoc-Partials.txt](Pandoc-Partials.txt) is passed into the template as\nthe \"body\" element where it says `${body}`. See this Pandoc \n[User Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates) for the basics.\n\nExample 1 rendered: [index1.htm](index1.htm)\n\nVariables and metadata\n----------------------\n\nPandoc's documentation is good at describing the\nways of referencing a variable or using the built-in\ntemplate functions. Where do the variables get their values?\nThe easiest way I've found is to set the variables values in\na JSON metadata file.  While Pandoc can also use the metadata\ndescribed in YAML front matter Pandoc doesn't support some of the\nother common front matter formats.  If you're using another format\nlike JSON or TOML for front matter there are tools which can split\nthe front matter from the rest of the markdown document. For\nthis example I have created the metadata as JSON in a file\ncalled [metadata.json](metadata.json).\n\nExample [metadata.json](metadata.json):\n\n~~~{.json}\n\n    {\n        \"title\": \"Pandoc Partial Examples\",\n        \"nav\": [\n            {\"label\": \"Pandoc-Partials\", \"href\": \"Pandoc-Partials.html\" },\n            {\"label\": \"Version 1\", \"href\": \"index1.htm\" },\n            {\"label\": \"Version 2\", \"href\": \"index2.htm\" },\n            {\"label\": \"Version 3\", \"href\": \"index3.htm\" }\n        ]\n    }\n\n~~~\n\nLet's modify our initial template to include our simple navigation\nand title.\n\nExample [index2.tmpl](index2.tmpl):\n\n~~~{.html-code}\n\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html>\n    <head>\n      ${if(title)}<title>${title}</title>${endif}\n    </head>\n    <body>\n    <nav>\n    ${for(nav)}<a href=\"${it.href}\">${it.label}</a>${sep}, ${endfor}\n    </nav>\n    <section>\n    ${body}\n    </section>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n\n~~~\n\nWe would include our navigation metadata with a Pandoc command like\n\n~~~{.shell}\n\n    pandoc --from=markdown --to=html \\\n           --template=index2.tmpl \\\n           --metadata-file=metadata.json Pandoc-Partials.txt > index2.htm\n\n~~~\n\nWhen we render this we now should be able to view a web page\nwith simple navigation driven by the JSON file as well as the\nbody content contained in the Pandoc-Partials.txt file.\n\nExample 2 rendered: [index2.htm](index2.htm)\n\nPartials\n--------\n\nSometimes you have more complex documents. Putting this all in\none template can become tedious. Web designers use a term called\n\"partials\". This usually means a template for a \"part\" of a page.\nIn our initial example we can split our navigation into it's own\ntemplate.\n\nImplementing partials\n---------------------\n\nPandoc will look in the current directory for partials as well\nas in a sub directory called \"templates\" of the current direct.\nIn this example I am going to include my partial template for\nnavigation in the current directory along side my\n[index3.tmpl](index3.tmpl).  My navigation template is called\n[nav.tmpl](nav.tmpl).\n\nHere's my partial template:\n\n~~~{.html-code}\n\n    <nav>\n    ${for(nav)}<a href=\"${it.href}\">${it.label}</a>${sep}, ${endfor}\n    </nav>\n\n~~~\n\nHere's my third iteration of our index template, [index3.tmpl](index3.tmpl).\n\n~~~{.html-code}\n\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html>\n    <head>\n    ${if(title)}<title>${title}</title>${endif}\n    </head>\n    <body>\n    ${if(nav)}\n    ${nav.tmpl()}\n    ${endif}\n    <section>\n    ${body}\n    </section>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n\n~~~\n\nPandoc only requires you to reference the partial by using\nits base name. Many people will name their templates with the\nextension \".html\". I find this problematic as if you're trying\nto list the templates in the directory you can not easily list\nthem separately. I use the \".tmpl\" extension to identify my templates.\nSince I have other documents that share the base name \"nav\" I\nexplicit call my navigation partial using the full filename followed\nby the open and closed parenthesis. I have also chosen to wrap\nthe template in an \"if\" condition. That way if I don't want navigation\non a page I skip defining it in my metadata file.\n\nInside the partial template we inherit the parent metadata object.\nYou can use all the built-in Pandoc template functions and variables\nprovided by Pandoc in your partial templates.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n~~~{.shell}\n\n    pandoc --from=markdown --to=html \\\n           --template=index3.tmpl \\\n           --metadata-file=metadata.json Pandoc-Partials.txt > index3.htm\n\n~~~\n\nExample 3 rendered: [index3.htm](index3.htm)\n\n\n",

Kernighan and P. J.\nPlauger's called [Software Tools in Pascal](https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern). The book is available from the\n[Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) and physical copies\nare still (2020) commonly available from used book sellers.\nThe book was an late 20th century text on creating portable\ncommand line programs using ISO standard Pascal of the era.\n\nIn this chapter K & P focuses on developing the idea of filters.\nFilters are programs which typically process standard input, do\nsome sort of transformation or calculation and write to standard\noutput.  They are intended to work either standalone or in a pipeline\nto solve more complex problems. I like to think of filters as\nsoftware [LEGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego).\nFilter programs can be \"snapped\" together creating simple shapes\ndata shapes or combined to for complex compositions.\n\nThe programs from this chapter include:\n\n+ **entab**, respecting tabstops, convert strings of spaces to tabs\n+ **overstrike**, this is probably not useful anymore, it would allow \"overstriking\" characters on devices that supported it. From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overstrike), \"In typography, overstrike is a method of printing characters that are missing from the printer's character set. The character was created by placing one character on another one — for example, overstriking \"L\" with \"-\" resulted in printing a \"Ł\" (L with stroke) character.\"\n+ **compress**, an early UNIX style compress for plain text files\n+ **expand**, an early UNIX style expand for plain text files, previously run through with **compress**\n+ **echo**, write echo's command line parameters to standard output, introduces working with command line parameters\n+ **translit**, transliterate characters using a simple from/to substitution with a simple notation to describe character sequences and negation. My implementation diverges from K & P\n\nImplementing in Oberon-07\n------------------------\n\nWith the exception of **echo** (used to introduce command line parameter processing) each program increases in complexity.  The last program **translit**is the most complex in this chapter.  It introducing what we a \"domain specific language\" or \"DSL\".  A DSL is a notation allowing us to describe something implicitly rather than explicitly. All the programs except **translit** follow closely the original Pascal translated to Oberon-07.  **translit** book implementation is very much a result of the constraints of Pascal of the early 1980s as well as the minimalist assumption that could be made about the host operating system. I will focus on revising that program in particular bring the code up to current practice as well as offering insights I've learned.\n\n\nThe program **translit** introduces what is called a \"Domain Specific Language\".Domain specific languages or DSL for short are often simple notations to describe how to solve vary narrow problems.  If you've used any of the popular spreadsheet programs where you've entered a formula to compute something you've used a domain specific language.  If you've ever search for text in a document using a regular expression you've used a domain specific language.  By focusing a notation on a small problem space you can often come up with simple ways of expressing or composing programmatic solutions to get a job done.\n\nIn **translit** the notation let's us describe what we want to translate. At the simplest level the **translit** program takes a character and replaces it with another character. What make increases **translit** utility is that it can take a set of characters and replace it with another.  If you want to change all lower cases letters and replace them with uppercase letters. This \"from set\" and \"to set\" are easy to describe as two ranges, \"a\" to \"z\" and \"A\" to \"Z\".  Our domain notation allows us to express this as \"a-z\" and \"A-Z\".  K & P include several of features in there notation including characters to exclude from a translation as well as an \"escape notation\" for describing characters like new lines, tabs, or the characters that describe a range and exclusion (i.e. dash and caret).\n\n\n\n2.1 Putting Tabs Back\n=====================\n\n[Page 31](https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/31/mode/1up)\n\nImplementing **entab** in Oberon-07 is straight forward.\nLike my [Detab](Detab.Mod) implementation I am using\na second modules called [Tabs](Tabs.Mod). This removes\nthe need for the `#include` macros used in the K & P version.\nI have used the same loop structure as K & P this time.\nThere is a difference in my `WHILE` loop. I separate the\ncharacter read from the `WHILE` conditional test.  Combining the\ntwo is common in \"C\" and is consistent with the programming style\nother books by Kernighan.  In Oberon-07 doesn't make sense at all.\nOberon's `In.Char()` is not a function returning as in the Pascal\nprimitives implemented for the K & P book or indeed like in the \"C\"\nlanguage. In Oberon's \"In\" module the status of a read operation is\nexposed by `In.Done`. I've chosen to put the next call to\n`In.Char()` at the bottom of my `WHILE` loop because it is clear\nthat it is the last think done before ether iterating again or\nexiting the loop.

It very much\nreflects an error where teletype like devices where still common and\nprinters printed much like typewriters did. On a 20th century\nmanual type writer you could underline a word or letter by backing\nup the carriage then typing the underscore character. Striking out\na word was accomplished by a similar technique. The mid to late\n20th century computers device retained this mechanism though by\n1980's it was beginning to disappear along with manual typewriters.\nThis program relies on the the nature of ASCII character set and\nreflects some of the non-print character's functionality. I\nfound it did not work on today's terminal emulators reliably. Your\nmileage may very nor do I have a vintage printer to test it on.\n\nOur module follows K & P design almost verbatim. The differences\nare those suggested by differences between Pascal and Oberon-07.\nLike in previous examples we don't need to use an ENDFILE constant\nas we can simply check the value of `In.Done` to determine\nif the last read was successful. This simplifies some of\nthe `IF/ELSE` logic and the termination of the `REPEAT/UNTIL`\nloop.  It makes the `WHILE/DO` loop a little more verbose.\n\nOne thing I would like to point out in the original Pascal of the\nbook is a problem often referred to as the \"dangling else\" problem.\nWhile this is usually discussed in the context of compiler\nimplementation I feel like it is a bigger issue for the person\nreading the source code. It is particularly problematic when you\nhave complex \"IF/ELSE\" sequences that are nested.  This is not\nlimited to the 1980's era Pascal. You see it in other languages\nlike C.  It is a convenience for the person typing the source code\nbut a problem for those who maintain it. We see this ambiguity in\nthe Pascal procedure **overstrike** inside the repeat loop\non [page 35](https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/35/mode/1up).\nIt is made worse by the fact that K & P have taken advantage of\nomitting the semi-colons where optional. If you type in this\nprocedure and remove the indication if quickly becomes ambiguous\nabout where on \"IF/ELSE\" begins and the next ends. In Oberon-07 it\nis clear when you have a dangling \"IF\" statement. This vintage\nPascal, not so much.\n\nK & P do mention the dangling \"ELSE\" problem later in the text.\nTheir recommend practice was include the explicit final \"ELSE\"\nat a comment to avoid confusion. But you can see how easy an\nomitting the comment is in the **overstrike** program.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\nThis is documented \"BUG\" section describes the limitations\nwell, \"**overstrike** is naive about vertical motions and non-\nprinting characters. It produces one over struck line for each\nsequence of backspaces\". But in addition to that most printing\ndevices these days either have their own drivers or expect to work\nwith a standard like Postscript. This limited the usefulness of\nthis program today though controlling character movement in a\n\"vt100\" emulation using old fashion ASCII control codes is\nstill interesting if only for historical reasons.\n\n\nProgram Documentation\n---------------------\n\n[Page 36](https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/36/mode/1up)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPROGRAM\n\n  overstrike    replace overstrikes by multiple-lines\n\nUSAGE\n\n  overstrike\n\nFUNCTION\n\n  overstrike copies in input to its output, replacing lines\n  containing backspaces by multiple lines that overstrike\n  to print the same as input, but containing no backspaces.\n  It is assumed that the output is to be printed on a device\n  that takes the first character of each line as a carriage\n  control; a blank carriage control causes normal space before\n  print, while a plus sign '+' suppresses space before print\n  and hence causes the remainder of the line to overstrike\n  the previous line.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n  Using <- as a visible backspace:\n\n    overstrike\n    abc<-<-<-___\n     abc\n    +___\n\nBUGS\n\n  overstrike is naive about vertical motions and non-printing\n  characters.

If you were\nprimarily working with text you still worried about running out of\nspace in your storage medium. You see it in the units\nof measurement used in that era such as bytes, kilobytes, hertz and\nkilohertz. To day we talk about megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes and\npetabytes. Plain text files are a tiny size compared to must\ndigital objects today but in the late 20th century\ntheir size in storage was still a concern.  One way to solve this\nproblem was to encode your plain text to use less storage space.\nEarly attempts at file compression took advantage of repetition to\nsave space. Many text documents have repeated characters\nwhether spaces or punctuation or other formatting. This is what\ninspired the K & P implementation of **compress** and **expand**.\nToday we'd use other approaches to save space whether we were\nstoring text or a digital photograph.\n\n\nProgram Documentation\n---------------------\n\n[Page ](https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/40/mode/1up)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPROGRAM\n\n    compress    compress input by encoding repeated characters\n\nUSAGE\n\n    compress\n\nFUNCTION\n\n    compress copies its input to its output, replacing strings\n    of four or more identical characters by a code sequence so\n    that the output generally contains fewer characters than the\n    input.

As previously I've chosen a\n`REPEAT ... UNTIL` loop structure because we are always attempting\nto read at least once. The `IF THEN ELSIF ELSE` logic is a little\ndifferent. In the K & P version they combine retrieving\na character and testing its value.  This is a style common in\nlanguages like C. As previous mentioned I split the read of the\ncharacter from the test.  Aside from the choices imposed by the\n\"In\" module I also feel that retrieving the value, then testing is\na simpler statement to read. There is little need to worry about a\nside effect when you separate the action from the test. It does\nchange the structure of the inner and outer `IF` statements.\n\n\n\nProgram Documentation\n---------------------\n\n[Page 43](https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/43/mode/1up)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPROGRAM\n\n    expand  expand compressed input\n\nUSAGE\n\n    expand\n\nFUNCTION\n\n    expand copies its input, which has presumably been encoded by\n    compress, to its output, replacing code sequences -nc by the\n    repeated characters they stand for so that the text output\n    exactly matches that which was originally encoded.

Much of this is a result of\nOberon evolution beyond Pascal. First Oberon counts arrays from\nzero instead of one so I have opted to use -1 as a value to\nindicate the index of a character in a string was not found.\nEqually I have simplified the logic in `xindex()` to make it clear\nhow I am handling the index lookup described in `index()` of the\nPascal implementation. K & P implemented `makeset()` and `dodash()`.\n`dodash()` particularly looked troublesome. If you came across the\nfunction name `dodash()` without seeing the code comments\n\"doing a dash\" seems a little obscure.  I have chosen to name\nthat process \"Expand Sequence\" for clarity. I have simplified the\ntask of making sets of characters for translation into three cases\nby splitting the test conditions from the actions. First check to\nsee if we have an escape sequence and if so handle it. Second check\nto see if we have an expansion sequence and if so handle it else\nappend the char found to the end of the set being assembled. This\nresulted in `dodash()` being replaced by `IsSequence()` and\n`ExpandSequence()`.  Likewise `esc()` was replaced with `IsEscape()`\nand `ExpandEscape()`. I renamed `addchar()` to `AppendChar()`\nin the \"Chars\" module as that seemed more specific and clearer.\n\nI choose to advance the value used when expanding a set description\nin the loop inside of my `MakeSet()`. I minimized the side effects\nof the expand functions to the target destination.  It is clearer\nwhile in the `MakeSet()` loop to see the relationship of the test\nand transformation and how to advance through the string. This also\nallowed me to use fewer parameters to procedures which tends to\nmake things more readable as well as simpler.\n\nI have included an additional procedure not included in the K & P\nPascal of this program. `Error()` displays a string and halts.\nK & P provide this as part of their Pascal environment. I have\nchosen to embed it here because it is short and trivial.\n\nTranslit suggested the \"Chars\" module because of the repetition in\nprevious programs. In K & P the approach to code reuse is to create\na separate source file and to included via a pre-processor. In\nOberon we have the module concept.\n\nMy [Chars](Chars.Mod) module provides a useful set of test\nprocedures like `IsAlpha(c)`, `IsUpper(c)`, `IsLower()` in addition\nto the `CharInRange()` and `IsAlphaNum()`.  It also includes\n`AppendChar()` which can be used to append a single character value\nto an end of an array of char.\n\n\nProgram Documentation\n---------------------\n\n[Page 56](https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/56/mode/1up)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPROGRAM\n\n    translit    transliterate characters\n\nUSAGE\n\n    translit    [^]src [dest]\n\nFUNCTION\n\n    translit maps its input, on a character by character basis, and\n    writes the translated version to its output.In the simplest case,\n    each character is the argument src is translated to the\n    corresponding character is the argument dest; all other characters\n    are copies as is.

If dest is absent, all characters represented by src are\n    deleted. Otherwise, if dest is shorter than src, all characters\n    is src that would map to or beyond the last character in\n    dest are mapped to the last character in dest; moreover adjacent\n    instances of such characters in the input are represented in the\n    output by a single instance of the last character in dest.

K & P have given\nus a solid foundation on which to build more complex and ambitious\nprograms. In the following chapters the read will find an\naccelerated level of complexity bit also programs that are\nsignificantly more powerful.\n\nOberon language evolved with the Oberon System which had a very\ndifferent rich text user interface when compared with POSIX.\nFortunately Karl's OBNC comes with a set of modules that make\nOberon-07 friendly for building programs for POSIX operating systems.\nI've taken advantage of his `extArgs` module much in the way\nthat K & P relied on a set of primitive tools to provide a common\nprogramming environment. K & P's version of\n[implementation of primitives](https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/315/mode/1up)\nlisted in their appendix. Karl's OBNC extensions modules are\ndescribed on [website](https://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/ext/).\nOther Oberon compilers provide similar modules though implementation\nspecific. A good example is Spivey's [Oxford Oberon-2 Compiler](https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Oxford_Oberon-2_compiler).\nK & P chose to target multiple Pascal implementations, I have the\nluxury of targeting one Oberon-07 implementation. That said if you\nadded a pre-processor like K & P did you could also take their approach\nto allow you Oberon-07 code to work across many Oberon compiler\nimplementations. I leave that as an exercise for the reader.\n\nI've chosen to revise some of the code presented in K & P's book. I\nbelieve the K & P implementations still contains wisdom in their\nimplementations. They had different constraints and thus made\ndifferent choices in implementation. Understand the trade offs and\nchallenges to writing portable code capable of running in very\ndivergent set of early 1980's operating systems remains useful today.\n\nCompiling with OBNC:\n\n~~~\n\n    obnc -o entab Entab.Mod\n    obnc -o overstrike Overstrike.Mod\n    obnc -o compress Compress.Mod\n    obnc -o expand Expand.Mod\n    obnc -o echo Echo.Mod\n    obnc -o translit Translit.Mod\n\n~~~\n\n+ [Entab](Entab.Mod)\n    + [Tabs](Tabs.Mod), this one visited this one in last installment.\n+ [Overstrike](Overstrike.Mod)\n+ [Compress](Compress.Mod)\n+ [Expand](Expand.Mod)\n+ [Echo](Echo.Mod)\n+ [Translit](Translit.Mod)\n\t+ [Chars](Chars.Mod)\n\n<!--\nNext and Previous\n-----------------\n\n+ Next: [Files]()\n-->\n\nPrevious\n--------\n\n+ Previous: [Getting Started](../../09/29/Software-Tools-1.html)\n",

Mostly Oberon documents my exploration of the Oberon Language, Oberon System and the various rabbit holes I will inevitably fall into.\n\nA nice feature of Oberon\n------------------------\n\nOberon source code has a very nice property in that anything\nafter the closing end statement is ignored by the compiler.\nThis makes it a nice place to write documentation, program\nnotes and other ideas.\n\nI've gotten in the habit of writing up program docs and\nnotes there. When I prep to make a web document I used to\ncopy the source file, doing a cut and paste to re-order\nthe module code to the bottom of the document. I'd follow\nthat with adding headers and code fences. Not hard but\ntedious. Of course if I changed the source code I'd also\nhave to do another cut and paste edit. This program,\n`ObnToMd.Mod` automates that process.\n\nProgram Documentation\n---------------------\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPROGRAM\n\n  ObnToMd\n\nFUNCTION\n\n  This is a simple program that reads Oberon modules\n  from standard in and re-renders that to standard output\n  such that it is suitable to process with Pandoc or other\n  text processing system.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n  Read the source for this program and render a file\n  called \"blog-post.md\". Use Pandoc to render HTML.\n\n    ObnToMd <ObnToMd.Mod > blog-post.md\n    pandoc -s --metadata title=\"Blog Post\" \\\n        blog-post.md >blog-post.html\n\nBUGS\n\n  It uses a naive line analysis to identify the module\n  name and then the end of module statement. Might be\n  tripped up by comments containing the same strings.\n  The temporary file created is called \"o2m.tmp\" and\n  this filename could potentially conflict with another\n  file.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\n\nSource code for **ObnToMd.Mod**\n-------------------------------\n\n~~~\n\n(* ObnToMd.Mod - an simple filter process for reading\nan Oberon-07 module source file and rendering a markdown\nfriendly output suitable for piping into Pandoc. The\nfilter reads from standard input and writes to standard\noutput and makes use of a temp file name o2m.tmp which\nit removes after successful rendering.\n\n@Author R. S.

Doiel, 2020-07-08\n\nUPDATE (2020-08-15, RSD): When I added a post today I was VERY pleased to \nto see that GitHub now allows me to publish my blog via the \"main\" branch.\nIt's nice to see the change in the words we use.\n\n**Why does software development use the vocabulary of slavery and\nJim Crow to describe our creations?** What we call things matters.\nThis is especially true of the words we use day to day without thinking.\n\n```shell\n    git pull origin master\n```\n\n\"Naming things is a hard problem in computer science.\" That is\na phrase I remember from my student days. We name variables,\nprograms and algorithms. We name architectures. Naming is a choice.\nThe names convey meaning and intent. Names and terms are a human\ncommunication. They matter.\n\n```shell\n    git push origin master\n```\n\n\n## Names can change\n\nI remember the first time I encountered the terminology \"master/slave\"\ndescribing network and database architecture. I remember cringing at\nthe terms. I accepted the terminology because I was a student and\nnaively assumed that those terms were chosen innocently and did not\nmean what they did. I was wrong.\n\nExample MySQL command:\n\n```sql\n    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST=host1,\n    MASTER_PORT=3002 FOR CHANNEL 'channel2';\n```\n\nWhen I did not challenge the use of those terms in computer science\nI became complicit in the status quo of systemic racism. I am not happy\nabout that. Not then and not now.  We need inclusive language\nin engineering. We need real diversity to find solutions to\ntoday's challenges.  In software engineering we very much control what\nwe call things. Software is an explicit form of written human\ncommunication. Words count. Words directly impact culture and our\ncommunity.\n\nExample MySQL commands:\n\n```sql\n    START SLAVE;\n    RESET SLAVE;\n    STOP SLAVE;\n```\n\nAs a direct benefactor of white male privilege I find the\nterminology of \"master/slave\" offensive.  I am certain those\nwords caused injury to those who did not benefit from the same white\nmale privilege.  Using \"master/slave\" terminology to describe database,\nreplication, network architectures or as used with version control\nsystems like Git is like polishing statues that glorify slavery.\nIt endorses inhumanity in a subtle and casual way.\n\nWe have a choice about how we communicate and what we communicate\nto convey meaning.  Let's use better words. It is time to change\nsome.\n\n\n## Practice Change\n\n**To change our community's vocabulary we need to thoughtfully choose terms**.\nMy friends and colleagues introduced me to using the term \"main\" as\na better descriptive word than \"master\" in Git repositories. When\nI started making the branch name changes in my Git repositories I ran\nacross a problem at GitHub.\n\n\n## Note the problem\n\nRecently GitHub made it possible to easily change the default branch.\nFor a number of years you could change the published documentation\nbranch from \"gh-pages\" to something you prefer.\nWhat you can't do is change the name of the branch used to publish\npersonal and group websites.  **GitHub explicitly states that the\npublication branch must be named \"master\".** I tested this and\nconfirmed the documentation is accurate as of today (2020-07-08, morning).\n\nWith the recent improvements in GitHub to allow default branches to\nbe named better it seems odd that you still have to publish\npersonal and group pages to \"master\" in order to publish a website. It\nnever made sense to me that person and group pages didn't use the default\nof \"gh-pages\" in the first place.\n\n\n## Taking action\n\nMorning (2020-07-08): I submitted a ticket to GitHub asking to have\nthe option of using another word besides \"master\" for the publication\nbranch in publishing my personal GitHub pages (i.e. this blog).\nUnfortunately the ticket doesn't have a public URL. I don't know how many\nother people have submitted similar requests. If only a few people\nhave requested this recently it will not be changed. Such is the nature\nof systemic problems.\n\nPlease help improve the words and names we use in software.\nI believe it can make a difference in creating a more inclusive and\nequitable community and profession. Raise the issue when it comes to\nyour attention. Silence becomes acceptance with systemic problems.\n\n## A reply\n\nEvening (2020-07-08): I got a reply today from Steve G of customer\nsupport. Not sure if the reply is a bot or human.  It was a nice polite\nreply (I wrote a nice polite ticket).  Steve mentioned that CEO Nat\nFriedman had addressed this on twitter and to follow the GitHub blog\nnews.  Steve said dropping master was a priority for GitHub but there\nis no time line for implementation.\n\nI am not sure how you can develop software with a priority in mind and\nnot have a sense of time it takes to implement it.  I mentioned that in my\nresponse to Steve G.\n\nAfter some Duck Duck searching I found a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955) dated June 15th, 2020 where Nat made the\nannouncement about Microsoft's GitHub making the change away from \"master\".\nNext week is July 15th. It will be interesting to see how much of an unscheduled priority this change is.\n\nI am skeptical.  If Steve G had indicated that they are actively working\nthe problem and provided a general time range I would be more inclined to\ngive Nat, GitHub and Microsoft the benefit of the doubt.  Given the rest\nof the content I read on Nat's twitter feed I don't think this is a priority\nbeyond press, publicity and stock price.\n\n\n## Where to go from here?\n\nJust as many sites have adopted more gender neutral terms in documentation\npractice we should encourage better descriptive terms for our algorithms,\nand architectures. If you run into terms perpetuating exclusion please\nspeak up.  Most of the web runs on web servers and databases.  Like GitHub\nthose software projects frequently use the terminology of \"master/slave\".\nIt is especially prevalent in documentation about replication. Blindly\nperpetuating the \"master/slave\" terminology to describe distributed\nsoftware and architectures is like polishing a statue to the old\nConfederacy. It can and should be change. We can communicate better\nwithout perpetuating the vocabulary of Jim Crow, segregation, slavery\nand oppression.\n\n",

Doiel, 2020-07-07\n\nThis is the tenth post in the [Mostly Oberon](../../04/11/Mostly-Oberon.html) series.\nMostly Oberon documents my exploration of the Oberon Language, Oberon System and the \nvarious rabbit holes I will inevitably fall into.\n\nIn my last post I looked at how Oberon-07 supports the passing of procedures as parameters in a procedure. In this one I am looking at how we can\ninclude procedures as a part of an Oberon RECORD. \n\nLet's modify our module name [Noises.Mod](Noises.Mod) to explore this.\nCopy \"Noises.Mod\" to \"Creatures.Mod\". Replace the \"MODULE Noises;\" line with\n\"MODULE Creatures;\" and the final \"END Noises.\" statement with \"END Creatures.\".\n\n\n~~~\n\n    MODULE Creatures;\n    \n    (* rest of code here *)\n\n    END Creatures.\n\n~~~\n\n\nThe key to supporting records with procedures as record attributes is once again Oberon's type system.  The type `Noise` we created in the previous post can also be used to declare a record attribute similar to how we use this new type to pass the procedure. In this exploration will create a linked list of \"Creature\" types which include a \"MakeNoise\" attribute.\n\nFirst let's define our \"Creature\" as a type as well as a \n`CreatureList`. Add the following under our `TYPE` \ndefinition in [Creatures.Mod](Creatures.Mod).\n\n\n~~~\n\n    Creature = POINTER TO CreatureDesc;\n    CreatureDesc = RECORD\n                     name : ARRAY 32 OF CHAR;\n                     noises : Noises;\n                   END;\n\n~~~\n\n\nLet's create a new `MakeCreature` procedure that will create\na populate a single `Creature` type record.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    PROCEDURE MakeCreature(name : ARRAY OF CHAR; noise : Noise; VAR creature : Creature);\n    BEGIN\n      NEW(creature);\n      creature.name := name;\n      creature.noise := noise;\n    END MakeCreature;\n\n~~~\n\n\nNow lets modify `MakeNoise` to accept the `Creature` type RECORD\nrather than a name and a noise procedure parameter.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    PROCEDURE MakeNoise(creature : Creator);\n    BEGIN\n      creature.noise(creature.name);\n    END MakeNoise;\n\n~~~\n\n\nHow does this all work?  The two \"Noise\" procedures \n\"BarkBark\" and \"ChirpChirp\" remain as in our original \n\"Noises\" module. But our new `MakeNoise` procedure\nlooks takes a `Creature` record rather than accepting a\nname and procedure as parameters. This makes the code \na little more concise as well as lets you evolve the\ncreature record type using an object oriented approach.\n\nOur revised module should look like this.\n\n\n~~~\n\n    MODULE Noises;\n      IMPORT Out;\n    \n    TYPE \n      Noise = PROCEDURE(who : ARRAY OF CHAR);\n\n      Creature = RECORD\n                   name : ARRAY 32 OF CHAR;\n                   noises : Noises;\n                 END;\n    \n    VAR\n      dog, bird : Creature;\n\n    PROCEDURE BarkBark(who : ARRAY OF CHAR);\n    BEGIN\n      Out.String(who);\n      Out.String(\": Bark, bark\");Out.Ln();\n    END BarkBark;\n    \n    PROCEDURE ChirpChirp(who : ARRAY OF CHAR);\n    BEGIN\n      Out.String(who);\n      Out.String(\": Chirp, chirp\");Out.Ln();\n    END ChirpChirp;\n    \n    PROCEDURE MakeNoise(creature : Creature);\n    BEGIN\n      (* Call noise with the animal name *)\n      creature.noise(creature.name);\n    END MakeNoise;\n\n    PROCEDURE MakeCreature(name : ARRAY OF CHAR; noise : Noise; VAR creature : Creature);\n    BEGIN\n      NEW(creature);\n      creature.name := name;\n      creature.noise := noise;\n    END MakeCreaturel\n    \n    BEGIN\n      MakeCreature(\"Fido\", BarkBark, dog);\n      MakeCreature(\"Tweety\", ChirpChirp, bird);\n      MakeNoise(dog);\n      MakeNoise(bird);\n    END Noises.\n\n~~~\n\n\nWhere to go from here? Think about evolving [Creatures](Creatures.Mod) so\nthat you can create a dynamic set of creatures that mix and match their\nbehaviors. Another idea would be to add a \"MutateCreature\" procedure\nthat would let you change the noise procedure to something new.\n\n\n### Next and Previous \n\n+ Next [Portable Oberon-07](../../08/15/Portable-Oberon-07.html)\n+ Previous [Procedures as parameters](../../06/20/Procedures-as-parameters.html) \n\n\n",

      "content": "\nOberon Loops and Conditions\n===========================\n\nBy R. S. Doiel, 2020-04-19\n\nThis is the four post in the [Mostly Oberon](../11/Mostly-Oberon.html) series. Mostly Oberon documents my exploration of the Oberon Language, Oberon System and the various rabbit holes I will inevitably fall into.\n\n## Data Flow\n\nOberon is a small systems language and while it is minimalist.\nIt provides you with the necessary primitives to get things done.\nI've touched on code organization, basic types and basic type\nextensions in the previous articles.  I have shown the basic\ncontrol statements but have not talked about them yet.\n\nOberon offers four basic control statements. \n\nIF, ELSIF, ELSE\n: Basic condition test and execution\n\nASSERT\n: A mechanism to trigger a program halt\n\nWHILE DO, ELSIF DO\n: The Loop structure in the language (aside from recursive procedures)\n\nFOR TO, FOR TO BY\n: A counting Loop where incrementing a counter by an integer value (e.g. 1 or by a specified constant).\n\n## IF, ELSIF, ELSE\n\nThe first two provide for conditional statements of the form\nif a condition is true do something. Almost ever computer language\nhas some form of a conditional express and the Oberon IF, ELSIF,\nELSE typical of what you find is more computer languages today.\nBoth ELSIF and ELSE are optional.\n\n```Oberon\n    IF (s = \"Freda\") OR (s = \"Mojo\") THEN\n      Out.String(\"Wowie Zowie! I remember you from ZBS stories.\");Out.Ln;\n    ELSIF (s = \"Bilbo\") OR (s = \"Gandolf\") THEN\n      Out.String(\"Greets, I remember from the Hobbit.\");Out.Ln;\n    ELSE\n      Out.String(\"Glad to meet you \");Out.String(s);Out.Ln;\n    END;\n```\n\n## ASSERT\n\nThe second expression, ASSERT, is a little different. If ASSERT\nevaluates an expression that is FALSE then your program is halted.\nThis is like combining an \"if EXPR is false then system exit\".\n\n```Oberon\n    Out.String(\"Should I continue? Y/n \");\n    In.Line(s);\n    Out.Ln;\n    ASSERT((s = \"Y\") OR (s = \"y\"));\n    (* If you didn't enter Y or y the program will halt *)\n```\n\n\n## WHILE DO, ELSIF DO\n\nOberon-07 also provides two loop structures. These are very \nsimilar to other languages as well. The only expectation is that\na while loop may contain an ELSIF which continues the loop\nexecution until both clauses return FALSE.\n\nThe basic while loop, counting 1 to 10.\n\n```Oberon\n    i := 0;\n    WHILE i < 10 DO\n       i := i + 1;\n       Out.Int(i, 1);Out.String(\" \");\n    END;\n```\n\nA while, elsif loop, counting 1 to 10, then 10 to 100 by 10.\n\n```Oberon\n    i := 0;\n    WHILE i < 10 DO\n       i := i + 1;\n       Out.Int(i, 1); Out.String(\" \");\n    ELSIF i < 100 DO\n       i := i + 10;\n       Out.Int(i, 1);Out.String(\" \");\n    END;\n```\n\n\n## FOR Loops\n\nThe FOR loop in Oberon is very similar to modern FOR loops.\nThe FOR loop increments an integer value with in a range.\nYou the default increments the start value by 1 but if a \nBY clause is included you can control how the increment value\nworks.\n\nRegular for loop, `i` is incremented by 1.\n\n```Oberon\n    FOR i := 1 TO 10 DO\n       Out.Int(i, 1);Out.String(\" \");\n    END;\n```\n\nUsing a BY clause incrementing `i` by 2.\n\n```Oberon\n    FOR i := 0 TO 20 BY 2  DO\n       Out.Int(i, 1);Out.String(\" \");\n    END;\n```\n\n\n## Putting it all together\n\nThe following [module](LoopsAndConditions.Mod) demonstrates\nthe conditional and loop syntax.\n\n```Oberon\n    MODULE LoopsAndConditions;\n      IMPORT In, Out;\n    \n    PROCEDURE IfElsifElseDemo;\n      VAR s : ARRAY 128 OF CHAR;\n    BEGIN\n      Out.String(\"Enter your name: \");\n      In.Line(s);\n      Out.Ln;\n      IF (s = \"Freda\") OR (s = \"Mojo\") THEN\n        Out.String(\"Wowie Zowie! I remember you from ZBS stories.\");Out.Ln;\n      ELSIF (s = \"Bilbo\") OR (s = \"Gandolf\") THEN\n        Out.String(\"Greets, I remember from the Hobbit.\");Out.Ln;\n      ELSE\n        Out.String(\"Glad to meet you \");Out.String(s);Out.Ln;\n      END;\n    END IfElsifElseDemo;\n    \n    PROCEDURE AssertDemo;\n      VAR s : ARRAY 128 OF CHAR;\n    BEGIN\n      Out.String(\"Should I continue? Y/n \");\n      In.Line(s);\n      Out.Ln;\n      ASSERT((s = \"Y\") OR (s = \"y\"));\n    END AssertDemo;\n    \n    PROCEDURE WhileDemo;\n      VAR i : INTEGER;\n    BEGIN\n      Out.String(\"Basic WHILE counting from 1 to 10\");Out.Ln;\n      i := 0;\n      WHILE i < 10 DO\n         i := i + 1;\n         Out.Int(i, 1);Out.String(\" \");\n      END;\n      Out.Ln;\n      Out.String(\"WHILE ELSIF, count 1 to 10 THEN 10 to 100\");Out.Ln;\n      i := 0;\n      WHILE i < 10 DO\n         i := i + 1;\n         Out.Int(i, 1); Out.String(\" \");\n      ELSIF i < 100 DO\n         i := i + 10;\n         Out.Int(i, 1);Out.String(\" \");\n      END;\n      Out.Ln;\n      Out.String(\"Demo of while loop counting one to ten, then by tenths.\");\n    END WhileDemo;\n    \n    PROCEDURE ForDemo;\n      VAR i : INTEGER;\n    BEGIN\n      Out.String(\"Basic FOR LOOP counting from 1 to 10\");Out.Ln;\n      FOR i := 1 TO 10 DO\n         Out.Int(i, 1);Out.String(\" \");\n      END;\n      Out.Ln;\n      Out.String(\"FOR loop counting by twos 1 to 20\");Out.Ln;\n      FOR i := 0 TO 20 BY 2  DO\n         Out.Int(i, 1);Out.String(\" \");\n      END;\n      Out.Ln;\n    END ForDemo;\n    \n    BEGIN\n      IfElsifElseDemo;\n      AssertDemo;\n      WhileDemo;\n      ForDemo;\n    END LoopsAndConditions.\n```\n\n\n### Next and Previous\n\n+ Next [Combining Oberon-07 and C with OBNC](../../05/01/Combining-Oberon-and-C.html)\n+ Previous [Basic Types](../18/Mostly-Oberon-Basic-Types.html)\n\n",
