Doiel, 2020-12-24\n\nThese are my notes for setting up a RetroFlag GPi case using Recalbox\ndistribution for retro gaming.\n\n+ RetroFlag GPi Case Kit (including a Raspberry Pi Zero W and blank SD Card)\n+ A computer to setup the SD Card  and the Raspberry Pi Imager v1.5\n\nWe will be installing [Recalbox](https://www.recalbox.com/ \"the all-in-one retro gaming console\")\nv7.7.x for Raspberry Pi Zero W and GPi case.  Recalbox which is a Retro\nGaming Linux distribution.\n\nSteps\n=====\n\nPreparing the 32 GiB SD Card\n---------------------------\n\n1. Download the appropriate Raspberry Pi Imager 1.5 from \n   https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/ for your system\n2. Install and launch the Raspberry Pi Imager\n3. Click \"Operating System\"\n  a. Select \"Emulation and game OS\"\n  b. Select \"Recalbox\"\n  c. Select \"Recalbox 7.1.1-Reloaded (Pi 0/1/GPi Case)\"\n4. Click \"SD Card\" \", then select the bank 32 GiB SD Card\n5. Click \"Write\"\n6. You will be asked remove the SD Card when done, do so and and exit \n   Raspberry Pi Imager\n\nNOTE: The current release of Recalbox (7.7.1) doesn't require patching\nwith \"GPI_Case_patch.zip\" or installing the shutdown scripts as suggested\non the RetroFlag website. Applying the patches will prevent the GPi\nfrom booting. The website instructions appear to be for an earlier release\nof Recalbox.\n\n\nInstalling the Raspberry Pi Zero W in the GPi Case\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThe RetroFlag comes with instructions to install the Raspberry Pi Zero W\nin the case. I found the pictorial instructions confusing. Doing a search\nfor \"RetroFlag GPi Case Setup\" yielded a link to [Howchoo's YouTube\nvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyJUlNifN1I&feature=youtu.be \"RetroFlag GPi CASE Setup and Usage\"),  This video also talks about setting up Retro Pi software,\nGPi case patches. Skip these. The instructions are now for software that\nis out of date (the video dates back to 2019). \n\nNOTE: Howchoo describes installing RetroPie not Recalbox. Don't install a\n\"wpa_supplicant.conf\" file or \"ssh\" file on the SD Card as suggested.\nIt is not needed and will cause problems.\n\nThe GPi case looks very much like a Game Boy. It includes a \"Game Pack\"\ntype module which will hold our Raspberry Pi once installed. I found the\nassembly instructions confusing but searching YouTube for \"RetroFlag GPi\nCase Setup\" listed several videos which describe the process of putting\nthe case together as well as how to install RetroPie or\nRecalbox Linux Distributions.\n\nBooting the Pi Zero W with the SD Card\n--------------------------------------\n\n1. Make sure the GPi Zero Case **IS NOT CONNECTED TO POWER**\n  a. the switch the case off\n  b. Disconnect the barrel to USB cable from a power source\n2. Remove the \"game pack\" element where you've installed the Raspberry Pi Zero W\n3. Insert the SD Card into the SD Card slot under the soft cover on the side of\n   the Game Pack case\n4. Re-insert \"Game Pack\" into side of the GPi case\n5. Plug the barrel USB cable into a USB Power supply , \n6. Turn the power switch to \"ON\" on the top of the GPi case\n7. Wait patiently, it's going to take several minutes to boot the first time\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Doiel, 2021-03-17\n\nIn this post I am walking through installing Native Oberon 2.3.7\n(aka ETH Oberon System 3) on a virtual machine running under\nVirtualBox 6.1. It is a follow up to my 2019 post \n[FreeDOS to Oberon System 3](/blog/2019/07/28/freedos-to-oberon-system-3.html \"Link to old blog post for bringing up Oberon System 3 in VirtualBox 6.0 using FreeDOS 1.2\"). To facilitate the install I will first prepare\nmy virtual machine as a FreeDOS 1.2 box. This simplifies getting the\nvirtual machines' hard disk partitioned and formatted correctly.\nWhen Native Oberon was released back in 1990's most Intel flavored\nmachines shipped with some sort Microsoft OS on them.  I believe\nthat is why the tools and instructions for Native Oberon assume\nyou're installing over or along side a DOS partition.\n\nBuilding our machine\n--------------------\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n1. Install VirtualBox 6.1 installed on your host computer.\n2. Download and install a minimal FreeDOS 1.2 as a virtual machine\n3. Downloaded a copy of Native Oberon 2.3.7 alpha from SourceForge\n3. Familiarized yourself Oberon's Text User Interface\n4. Boot your FreeDOS virtual machine using the Oberon0.Dsk downloaded\nas part of NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz\n5. Mount \"Oberon0.Dsk\" and start installing Native Oberon\n\nBefore you boot \"Oberon0.Dsk\" on your virtual machine make sure\nyou've looked at some online Oberon documentation. This is important.\nOberon is very different from macOS, Windows, Linux, DOS, CP/M or\nUnix. It is easy to read the instructions and miss important details \nlike how you use the three button mouse, particularly the selections\nand execute actions of text instructions.\n\nVirtual Machine Setup\n---------------------\n\nVirtualBox 6.1 can be obtained from [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/).  This involves downloading the installer for your particular host\noperating system (e.g. Linux, macOS or Windows) and follow the instructions\non the VirtualBox website to complete the installation.\n\nOnce VirtualBox is installed, launch VirtualBox.\n\nClick the \"New\" button and name your machine (e.g. \"Native Oberon 2.3.7 Alpha\") and choose type of \"Other\" and version \"DOS\". Click continue. I accepted\nthe default memory size of 32 MB. This is plenty for Oberon.  I clicked on create disk and accepted the default VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image). Press continue. I think accepted \"Dynamically allocated\", press continue. I chose a \"disk size\" of 100.00 MB. Oberon System is tiny. Press create button.\n\nMake sure your new machine is highlight on the left side of the VirtualBox\nmanagement panel. Click on Settings button, it looks like a gear towards\nthe top. Click \"Display\" on the model dialog and bump the Video Memory\nup to 128 MB. I also clicked Enable 3D Acceleration (though I don't think\nOberon uses this).  Before clicking OK click on the Network icon in the \nmodal dialog box. Change \"NAT\" to \"Bridged Adapter\". Now click \"OK\" to\nclose the modal dialog box. \n\nYour VirtualBox is now ready, before pressing \"Start\" we need\nto install FreeDOS 1.2.\n\nMake a FreeDOS 1.2 machine\n---------------------------\n\nDownload the [FD12CD.iso](https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.2/FD12CD.iso) file from the \n[FreeDOS project](https://freedos.org/download).\n\n\"Insert\" the \"FD12CD.ISO\" file into our VirtualBox 6.1\nCD-ROM drive. Go to the VirtualBox management panel. \nIn the area that summarizes storage click the word \"Empty\"\nin the line with \"[Optical Drive]\". Find the \"FD12CD.ISO\"\nyou downloaded and select it.\n\nNow press the green \"Start\" arrow in the VirtualBox management\npanel. This should start your virtual machine and it will boot\nusing the CD-ROM drive.\n\nThis will display a welcome screen with installation options.\nPress your \"tab\" key once. This should cause a boot string to be\ndisplayed. Type a space and then type the word \"raw\" (without quotes).\nPress enter. Next select the language you want to install with\n(e.g. English). Choose \"Yes - Continue with installation\" on the\nnext prompt. You should then be given a dialog box that\nindicates \"Drive C: does not appear to be partitioned.\", select\n\"Yes - Partition drive C:\". Then that completes press\n\"Yes - Please reboot now\". \n\nThis will cause the machine to reboot and you will be faced with\nthe \"Welcome to FreeDOS 1.2\" screen once again. Press the \"tab\"\nAdd a space and type \"raw\" to the boot string as before.\nSelect the language again then select \"Yes - Continue with \ninstallation\". The screen should now say something like\n\"Drive C: does not appear to be formatted\", select \n\"Yes - Please erase and format drive C:\".\n\nWhen done it'll gather some info on the system and ask you\nwhich keyboard you're using. Pick yours (e.g. \"US English (Default)\").\nIt will then give you a choice of what to install. Since we're\ngoing to overwrite this when we install Oberon just select\nthe base package, then select \"Yes - Please install FreeDOS 1.2\"\n\nBefore selecting \"Yes - Please reboot now\" when the install is\nfinished you want to \"eject\" your FD12CD.ISO from the virtual\nCD-ROM drive.  Switch back to your VirtualBox management panel.\nClick the text that says \"FD12CD.iso\" and select \"remove disk\nfrom virtual drive\" in the popup menu. Switch back to your\nVirtual machine and select \"Yes - Please reboot now\"\n\nIf all goes well the machine will boot into FreeDOS 1.2. When\nyou see the \"C:>\" prompt type \"shutdown\" (without the quotes)\nand press enter. We're now ready to start installing Native\nOberon 2.3.7.\n\n\nNative Oberon 2.3.7\n-------------------\n\nNative Oberon used to be hosted at ETH where Oberon and the Oberon\nSystem was first developed as a research and instructional project.\nUnfortunately this seems to no longer be supported by ETH. Prof. Wirth\nhas long been retired now and they no longer choose to use such a \nuseful language or Operating System. \n\nSourceForge has a mirror of the original sources and some of the\nremaining community has put at a \"new\" release of 2.3.7 Alpha \nbringing Native Oberon a little closer to the present. It's this\nversion we'll use. You can read more at the [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/) as well as at the [Oberon Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Oberon). ETH also still maintains an email\nlist for Oberon and it is active. It can be found at\nhttps://lists.inf.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/oberon. I recommend\nbrowsing the archives of the Email list if you run into problems.\nI've found very helpful information there and the people on the\nlist seem happy to answer a novices question.\n\nWe are going to be downloading files from the Native Oberon Project's\nFiles page at SourceForge.\n\n> https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/files/nativeoberon/\n\nIn the Files page download the instructions \n[NativeOberonInstall.pdf](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/files/NativeOberonInstall.pdf/download) \nor or the text version. This document by Pieter Muller (May 1999) explains\nthe installation process. It is good for its overview though I found\nthe actual process simpler than what was described for May 1999. \n\nOn the Files page you'll also see a green button to \"Download Latest Version\", NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz. Click the button and download it.\n\nThe NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz contains the files we'll need to run\nNativeOberon on our VirtualBox. Ungzip and untar the file into\na location that is convenient for you. I put mine\nin `src/NativeOberon-2.3.7` and I had downloaded the file into my\nhome directory's \"Downloads\" folder. \n\n```shell\n    mkdir -p src/NativeOberon-2.3.7\n    cd src/NativeObeorn-2.3.7\n    tar zxvf ~/Downloads/NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz\n```\n\nYou now have the software ready to proceed in installing the system\nin VirtualBox.\n\nNativeOberon in a VirtualBox\n----------------------------\n\nGo back to your VirtualBox management panel. We need to place\nhe boot disk image in the virtual floppy drive. In the files\nwe unpacked (i.e. ungzip and untar) there is a file named\n\"Oberon0.Dsk\".  We want to mount that in the virtual floppy drive.\nClick on the word \"Empty\" next to \"Floppy Device 0:\" in the management\npanel. You are then given a modal dialog box and we want to select \n\"Choose a disk file\". You can then find the files you save and \nselect \"Oberon0.Dsk\". \n\nBooting with Oberon0.Dsk\n------------------------\n\nWe can now click \"Start\" button at the top of the VirtualBox management\npanel. This will boot the virtual machine using \"Oberon0.Dsk\". Oberon\nitself loads completely into memory. \n\nYou now have a running Oberon System but we need to install it\non the virtual hard drive. Fortunately our running system comes with\nbuilt in instructions.  It is here that people how haven't \nused Oberon before are going to run into trouble.\n\nOberon System uses all three buttons of a three button mouse. On\nmost mice I've encountered to day there are two buttons and a\nscroll wheel. The scroll wheel is click able and functions like\nthe middle button on an Oberon mouse.\n\nThe left mount button sets the pointer, the middle button (our\nscroll wheel if your mouse is like mine) is used to execute\ncommands and the right mouse button is used to select text.\nIn our installation instructions displayed on our virtual \nmachine we generally be middle clicking the blue colored text. \n\nIn Native Oberon all text is potentially actionable.  Unlike in\nUnix where you type a command press enter then have to retype\n(or use the command history) to execute the next command we're\ngoing to click on the text and sometimes select text to execute\ncommands.  Before we proceed I highly recommend readying\nand trying a tutorial out before attempting to install Oberon\non your virtual hard drive. There is an [Oberon System 3 - Main Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20171226183816/http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/ethoberon/tutorial/) available at the Internet Archive's Wayback machine.\n\nInstalling to our Virtual Hard disk\n----------------------------------\n\nAlong the right side (in the system track) is the text \"Edit.Open Introduction.Text\". Click with your middle button (scroll wheel on my\nmouse) and this will open the text in the \"Edit\" track on the left\nside.  Read this text if you haven't before. Scrolling through\nthe text is a little different than the scroll bars on macOS, Windows,\nX Windows. They are on the left side and the middle mouse button\nsets the scroll position. The left button pages down, the right\npages up.  You can close the \"Introduction.Text\" windows by \nmiddle clicking \"System.Close\" in the upper menu bar.\n\nReview step 1.\n--------------\n\nWe need to configure the hard drive by middle clicking on\n\"Config.Desk Standard ATA/EIDE\"[^1]. In the console viewer above\nyou should see something like\n\n[^1]: This blue text makes it clear the command is actionable, like a link in the web browser. But the actual text is the command not the color.\n\n```\nDisk: Standard ATA/EIDE\nStatic BootLinker for OM Object Files / prk\n linking Native.Bin 255388\n```\n\nReview step 2.\n--------------\n\nMiddle click on \"Edit.Open InstallFiles.Tool\".  A \"Tool\" file\nis like a text file but usually contains instructions and\na sorta menu or recipe of commands.  In fact our instructions\nin the lower viewer of the system track is a \"Tool\" file called\n\"Install.Tool\".  Using \"Edit.Open\" to open the tool or text file\nopens a viewer on the left track, the edit track. If you had\nclicked on \"System.Open Install.Tool\" it would open a viewer\non the right, or systems track. In either track by default\nthe viewers will tile (not overlap).  If you want to close\na view you can click on \"System.Close\" in the viewer's menu\nbar. Now open our InstallFiles.Tool in the edit track.\n\nInstallFiles.Tool\n-----------------\n\nWe now are going to prepare our virtual hard drive. Like\nour \"Install.Tool\" text we have a series of instructions\nwhich commands we can click on (the ones in blue).\n\nMiddle click on \"Partitions.Show ~\". This will open a pain\nshowing the partition information. You should see something\nlike\n\n```\nDisk: Diskette0, GetSize: no media, removable\n\nDisk: IDE0, 99MB, VBOX HARDDISK\nIDE0#00        99MB  --- (Whole disk)\nIDE0#01        99MB  --- (Free)\n\nDisk: IDE2, GetSize: no media, removable, VBOX CD-ROM\n```\n\nThis tells us we have three drives in our VirtualBox\nvisible to Oberon.  The first is the floppy drive.\nIt shows \"no media\". That might seem odd but when you\nread the \"Oberon0.Dsk\" it read that into memory and the\nwhole OS is not running in memory, not from disk! While\nthe disk is still \"in the drive\" as far as VirtualBox\nis concerned it isn't \"mounted\" from the point of view of\nthe operating system.\n\nThe second disk section describes our virtual hard drive.\nThe third describes the virtual CD-ROM drive.\n\nWe're interested in using the disk \"IDE0\" with the\ndevice number of \"01\", we express that as \"IDE0#01\". \n\nIn the \"Partitions.Text\" viewer where we see the\npartitions information we can type the command\ndescribed in \"InstallFiles.Tool\"\n\n```\nPartitions.ChangeType IDE0#01 6 76 ~\n```\n\nWe then middle mouse click on line we just type. This\nshould produce output in the \"System.Log\" view in the\nupper right of the screen that looks like\n\n```\nIDE0#01 changed to type 76\n```\n\nI had to do a modified version of step 3 of \"InstallFiles.Tool\"\nchoosing option \"b\".\n\nIn the output of \"Partitions.show ~\" (i.e. the Partitions.Text\nviewer) want to middle click on the \"I\" of \"IDE0#01\".\nThen right mouse button select \"IDE0#01\". \n\nFrom 3a in the \"InstallFiles.Tool\" viewer middle mouse button\nclick on \"Partitions.Format ↑\". This should result in \nthe \"System.Log\" viewer showing \n\n```\nIDE0#01 format successful\n```\n\nAfter formatting the drive I was able to complete step 3b by\nmiddle clicking the commands as provided in the \"InstallFiles.Tool\"\n\n> NOTE: you may need to scroll that window to see all of step 3\n\nMiddle click on \"Partitions.UpdateBootFile ↑\" \nThe \"Systems.Log\" viewer should show\n\n```\nIDE#00 update successful\n```\n\nMiddle click on \"FilesSystem.Mount DST AosFS ↑\" in 3b. The\n\"System.Log\" viewer should show\n\n```\nDST: mounted\n```\n\nWe are ready for Step 4. This command does the brunt of the\nwork of coping things over. The command \"Configuration.DoCommands\"\ntake a list of Oberon commands and executes them one after the\nother. Middle Mouse click on \"Configuration.DoCommands\".\nThe \"System.Log\" viewer will show many messages that are\na result of each command taken. Make sure there are no errors.\nThe last series of commands renamed files so you should see\nsomething like\n\n```\nSystem.RenameFiles\nDST:Rel.Obeorn.Text => DST:Oberon.Text renaming\nDST:Rel.Network.Tool => DST:Network.Tool renaming\nDST:Rel.DOS.Tool => DST:DOS.Tool renaming\n```\n\nFor step 5 of \"InstallFiles.Tool\" we can close our \"InstallFiles.Tool\"\nviewer by middle clicking on \"System.Close\" in the menu bar. You can\nalso close the \"Partitions.Text\" viewer using its menu bar and\nmiddle clicking \"System.Close\".\n\nRight now we've formatted our hard drive and copied a bunch of \nfiles too it. We still need to configuration our system before\nit is self hosting.\n\nIn the \"Install.Tool\" viewer we want to open our \"Configure.Tool\".\nMiddle click on the \"Edit.Open Configure.Tool\".\n\nConfiguring our Oberon System\n-------------------------------\n\nThe configuration tool breaks configuration into a series of\nparts. First part is configure the display in Part two\nwe make the hard disk bootable.\n\nTo configure out display we want to middle click on the blue text in\n\"Config.DetectVesa (BIOS cal might hang some systems!)\".\nYou will be presented with a list of screen resolutions. I middle\nclicked the blue text in \"Config.Vesa 00000147H 1600 * 1200 * 32\".\nIn the \"System.Log\" viewer this showed\n\n```\nVesa mode 00000147H\n```\n\n> NOTE: You will likely need to scroll down the page using the scroll bar\n\nIn part two we need to decide how we want to boot Oberon. In our case\nI recommend Option 2, boot Oberon directly (non-FAT hosted). Middle\nclick the blue text \"Config.BootParition menu ~\".\nThe \"System.Log\" viewer should output\n\n```\nIDE0#01 config written\n```\n\nMiddle click the blue text \"Partitions.Show ~\". Like in \n\"InstallFiles.Tool\" this will open a new \"Partitions.Text\" \nviewer with content like\n\n```\nDisk: Diskette0, GetSize: no media, removable\n\nDisk: IDE0, 99MB, VBOX HARDDISK\nIDE0#00       99MB  --- (Whole disk)\nIDE0#01       99MB   76 * Native Oberon, Aos\n\nDisk: IDE2, GetSize: no media, removable, VBOX CD-ROM\n```\n\nUsing your right mouse button select \"IDE0#01\" then in the\n\"Configure.Tool\" viewer middle click the blue text\n\"Partitions.Activate ↑\". The \"System.Log\" viewer should\nshow\n\n```\nIDE0#01 already active\n```\n\nWe don't have a partition to deactivate so we can skip the last\nstep of option 2. This is a good place to \"eject\" our \nfloppy disk \"Oberon0.Dsk\" before we \"System.Reboot\".\n\nTo eject the disk click on \"Oberon0.Dsk\" in the VirtualBox\nmanager panel. The should then change the text to \"Empty\".\n\nFinally we're ready to move to the last step in \"Configure.Tool\".\nScroll down and find \"System.Reboot\". \nMiddle click on the blue text \"System.Reboot\". At this point\nthe virtualbox should reboot from the virtual hard drive.\nThis reboot will take a little longer than the floppy boot\nand the screen size of the virtualbox will be large based on the\nsettings you picked early. You have a minimal working Oberon\nSystem 3. Now to install some more programs and flesh the system out.\n\nInstall some programs\n---------------------\n\nFirst we need to get the zip files provided in \nNativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz on to the hard drive.  \nHistorically these were done via 1.44 MB floppy disks.\nWe're going to make it easier. Native Oberon 2.3.7 can\nread an ISO formatted CD-ROM. \n\nMaking our virtual CD-ROM\n-------------------------\n\nUnder Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS machine creating a ISO image\nis one command. Below is I am going to create an ISO \nimage of the directory \"NativeOberon-2.3.7\"\nand save the image as \"NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso\".\n\n```shell\n    mkisofs -J --iso-level 3 \\\n        -o NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso NativeOberon-2.3.7\n```\n\nThe `-J` says to use the Joliet extensions, the `--iso-level`\nsets the level of ISO support, in this case to 3. See\nthe manpage for `mkisofs` for details.\n\nOn macOS this involves two commands. First use\nthe \"Disk Utility\" to create an image of the folder\nwhere you unpacked NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz.\nThis will result in a \".dmg\" or disk image file common\non macOS.  Next we need to convert this to an ISO\nformatted image file.  For that we use a command line\nmacOS tool called `hdiutil` to convert the disk\nimage to an ISO format. In the process you will create\nthe ISO file but it will have the extension of \".cdr\".\nYou can rename (i.e. mv) that file so it has a \".iso\"\nextension. This is suitable to mount in VirtualBox's \nvirtual CD-ROM drive.\n\n```shell\n    hdiutil convert NativeOberon-2.3.7.dmg -format UDTO -o NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso\n    mv NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso.cdr NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso\n```\n\nGo to the VirtualBox 6.1 management panel and mount the\nISO image file you created. Now we're ready to return\nto our Native Oberon virtual machine.\n\nInstalling from an ISO CD-ROM\n-----------------------------\n\nI suggest create the following as it's own tool text.\nBut if you want you can also type in the commands and\nexecute one by one.\n\n```\nThese are the instructions from installing the Native\nOberon 2.3.7 zip archive files. Steps:\n\n1. See what the CD-ROM mount point by reviewing the partitions\n\n    Paritions.Show ~\n\nOn my virtual machine the second disk is IDE2 and that\nis where we'll find the CD-ROM.\n\n2. Mount the ISO image as CD\n\n    FileSystem.Mount CD ISOFS IDE2 ~\n\n3. Check to see what files are on the CD-ROM\n\n    System.Directory CD:* ~\n\n4. Copy the files from the CD-ROM to the harddisk\n\n    System.CopyFiles\n        CD:Apps1.zip => Apps1.zip\n        CD:Apps2.zip => Apps2.zip\n        CD:Docu.zip => Docu.zip\n        CD:Gadgets.zip => Gadgets.zip\n        CD:Pr3Fonts.zip => Pr3Fonts.zip\n        CD:Source1.zip => Source1.zip\n        CD:Source2.zip => Source2.zip\n        CD:Source3.zip => Source3.zip\n        ~\n\n5. Unzip all our archives using the ZipTool.\n\n    ZipTool.ExtractAll \\o \\p SYS:\n        Gadgets.zip Docu.zip Apps1.zip Apps2.zip\n        Pr3Fonts.zip Pr6Fonts.zip\n        Source1.zip Source2.zip Source3.zip\n        ~\n\n```\n\nYou should now have a full installed Native Oberon 2.3.7\nsystem running under VirtualBox 6.1. Enjoy your explorations.\n\n",

Doiel, 2021-04-02\n\nThis is a short article documenting how I install A2 Oberon\nin VirtualBox using the [FreeDOS 1.2](https://freedos.org),\nthe A2 [ISO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/a2oberon/files/) cd image and [VirtualBox 6.1](https://virtualbox.org).\n\nBasic Approach\n--------------\n\n1. Download the ISO images for FreeDOS and A2\n2. Create a new Virtual Machine\n3. Install FreeDOS 1.2 (Base install) in the virtual machine\n4. Install A2 from the ISO image over the FreeDOS installation\n\nFrom working with Native Oberon 2.3.7 I've found it very helpful\nto have a FreeDOS 1.2. installed in the Virtual machine first. \nI suspect the reason I have had better luck taking this approach\nis based on assumptions about the virtual hard disk being setup\nwith an existing known formatted, boot-able partition. In essence\nmaking our Virtualbox look like a fresh out of the box vintage PC.\n\nDownload the ISO Images for FreeDOS and A2\n------------------------------------------\n\nYou'll find FreeDOS 1.2 installation ISO image at \n[FreeDos.org](http://freedos.org/download/). Download it\nwhere you can easily find it from the VirtualBox manager.\n\nYou'll find the A2 Oberon ISO image at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/a2oberon/files/) in the A2 Files section. There is a green download\nbutton you can click and it'll take you to a downloads page and download\nthe ISO.  Once again move it to where you can find it from \nthe VirtualBox manager easily.\n\n\nCreate a new Virtual Machine\n----------------------------\n\nFire up VirtualBox.  Click the \"New\" icon. Given your machine\na descriptive name and set the Type to \"Other\" and version to \"DOS\".\nClick Next.\n\nOn the Memory Size panel select the memory size you want. I picked\n2048 MB. A2 like other Oberon are frugal in resource consumption.\nClick Next.\n\nOn the Hard Disk panel I accepted the default \"Create a virtual hard disk now\"\nand clicked \"Create\" button at the bottom of the panel.\n\nI accepted the default \"VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)\" and clicked\nNext.\n\nI accepted \"Dynamically allocated\" and clicked Next.\n\nI accepted the default name and 500 MB disk size and clicked\nCreate.\n\nThis returned me to the main VirtualBox manager panel. I click on \nthe \"Settings\" icon. This opens the Settings panel. I Clicked on the\n\"Display\" label in the left side of the panel. On the \"Screen\" tab\nI increased the Video Memory from 6 MB to 128 MB.  I also checked\nthe \"Enable 3D Acceleration\" box.\n\nNext I clicked  \"Network\" label in the left side of the panel.\nI changed the Attached to from \"NAT\" to \"Bridged Adapter\"\nbefore clicking \"OK\". This should return you to the manager panel.\n\nScroll down the description of your virtual machine so that the\n\"Storage\" section is visible. You should see \"IDE Secondary Device 0: \n[Optical Drive] Empty\". Click the the words \"Optical Drive\".\nYou be given a context menu, click on \"Choose a Disk file\". Navigate\nto where you saved the FressDOS ISO (e.g. FD12CD.iso).\nClick Open. This should return you to the manager panel and you\nshould see the \"FD12CD.iso\" file listed.\n\nInstall FreeDOS 1.2\n-------------------\n\nClick the \"Start\" button.  This should boot the machine. By\ndefault the search order for booting is floppy drive,\nCD-ROM drive then hard disk.  Since we have the FD12CD.iso\nmounted in the cd ROM drive it'll boot using it.\n\nWhen you see the \"Welcome\" screen press the tab key.\nYou should see a line describing the image it'll boot.  Click\ninto the Virtual machine's window and press the space bar\nthen type \"raw\" (without the quotes). Press the enter key.\n\nThis should return you to the install process, select your\nlanguage (e.g. English for me). The select \"Yes - Continue with the\ninstallations\". On the next screen select \"Yes - Partition drive C:\".\nThen select \"Yes - Please reboot now\". This will reboot the\nmachine and bring you back to the Welcome page. Once again\npress the tab key, press the space bar and type in \"raw\"\n(without the quotes).\n\nAs before select your language and select \"Yes - Continue with\nthe installation\". This time you should see the option \n\"Yes - Please erase and format drive C:\", select it. \nAfter formatting it ask you to select your keyboard type.\nIt will then give you the option of installing base or full\ninstallations (with our without source).  I suggest only\nselecting \"Base packages only\".  \n\nOn the next screen select \"Yes - Please install FreeDOS 1.2\".\nAfter it finishes you can select \"Yes - Please reboot now\".\nWhen the machine reboots you'll see the welcome screen again\nbut rather than press tab, select \"Boot system from hard disk\".\nPress enter to select the extended memory manager and you\nshould now be at the DOS \"C:>\" prompt.\n\nSwitch back to the VirtualBox manager panel and click on\n\"Optical Drive\" and click \"Remove disk from virtual drive\".\n\nInstalling A2 Oberon\n--------------------\n\nWe now should have a Virtual Machine ready to receive A2.\nClick the \"Optical Drive\" again and select the A2 ISO\nimage you downloaded from SourceForge previously.\nYour optical drive should show the full filename of\nthe ISO image, e.g. \"A2_Rev-6498_serial-trace.iso\"\nWe can now click the \"Start\" icon in the manager panel.\n\nA2 comes up running like a \"live CD\".  It's the full A2\nso you can play around with it if you want but we're going\nto install it on our virtual hard drive. At the bottom of the\nA2 desktop you should see a panel of buttons. Click the button\nlabeled \"System\". This will change the panel buttons below it.\nIn the lower panel you should see \"Installer\", click it. This\nwill bring up a \"Welcome to Oberon\" installer window. You will\nsee two presentations of drives. The upper one will be the hard\ndrive where we want to install A2 and the lower one is the \nvirtual CD ROM we're running. Click on the bar for the hard disk.\nBefore click the drive bar was red. After clicking it was yellow.\nThe text label above the var says, \"IDE0 (VBOX HARD DISK), Size \n500 MB, Open count 0\".\n\nIn the lower part of the panel click \"Quickinstall\", then\nanswer Yes to the model dialog that pops up. After a few moments \nA2 should finish installing itself on the virtual hard disk.  The lower\npanel's buttons will include one labeled \"Done\", press it. This\nwill close the installer window.\n\nAt the bottom of the desktop you should still see the System\npanel buttons. There is a red one labeled \"Shutdown\". Press it.\n\nThe virtual machine's screen should go black. On my machine\nI press the right control key (the host key) to release my\nmouse and keyboard from the virtual machine. Close the window\nand when it select \"Power of the machine\" in when VirtualBox\nprompts how to shut it down.\n\nLike with the FD12CD.iso we want to unmount our A2 installation\nCD ROM. Click on the \"Optical Drive\" in the manager panel\nand choose \"Remove disk from virtual Drive\". \n\nYou can now start the machine again and start exploring A2.\nI recommend looking at the [Oberon Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Oberon#A2_and_UnixAOS)\n for details about how to use A2 and ideas of what to explore.\n\nOne nice feature of A2 is it includes a full \"NativeOberon\"\nor ETH Oberon as an A2 Application.\n\n",

      "content": "\nUpdating Schema in SQLite3\n==========================\n\nBy R. S. Doiel, 2020-04-16\n\n[SQLite3](https://sqlite.org/docs.html) is a handy little\ndatabase as single file tool.  You can interact with the file\nthrough largely standard SQL commands and embed it easily into\napplications via the C libraries that the project supports.\nIt is also available from various popular scripting languages\nlike Python, PHP, and Lua. One of the things I occasionally\nneed to do and always seems to forget it how to is modify a\ntable schema where I need to remove a column[^1]. So here are\nsome of the basics do I can quickly find them later and avoid\nreading various articles tutorials because the search engines\ndoesn't return the page in the SQLite documentation.\n\n[^1]: The SQL `ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name` does not work in SQLite3\n\nIn the next sections I'll be modeling a simple person object\nwith a id, uname, display_name, role and updated fields.\n\nCreating a person table\n-----------------------\n\n\n```sql\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"person\" \n        (\"id\" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, \n        \"uname\" VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, \n        \"role\" VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, \n        \"display_name\" VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, \n        \"updated\" INTEGER NOT NULL);\n\n```\n\nAdding a column\n---------------\n\nWe will create a *junk* column which we will remove later.\n\n```sql\n\n.schema person\nALTER TABLE person ADD COLUMN junk VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;\n.schema person\n\n```\n\nDropping a column\n-----------------\n\nTo drop a column in SQLite you need to actually create\na new table, migrate the data into it then drop the old table\nand finally rename it. It is best to wrap this in a transaction.\n\n```sql\n\nBEGIN TRANSACTION;\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"person_new\" \n           (\"id\" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, \n           \"uname\" VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, \n           \"role\" VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, \n           \"display_name\" VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, \n           \"updated\" INTEGER NOT NULL);\n    INSERT INTO person_new\n           SELECT id, uname, role, display_name, updated\n           FROM person;\n    DROP TABLE person;\n    ALTER TABLE person_new RENAME TO person;\nCOMMIT;\n\n```\n\n\n",

      "content": "\nOfront on Raspberry Pi OS\n=========================\n\nBy R. S. Doiel, 2021-04-25\n\nThis post is about getting Ofront[^1] up and running on Raspberry Pi OS[^2].\nOfront provides a Oberon-2 to C transpiler as well as a Oberon V4[^3]\ndevelopment environment. There are additional clever tools like `ocat`\nthat are helpful working with the differences in text file formats between\nOberon System 3, V4 and POSIX. The V4 implementation sits nicely on top of\nPOSIX with minimal compromises that distract from the Oberon experience.\n\n[^1]: Ofront was developed by Joseph Templ, see http://www.software-templ.com/ \n\n[^2]: see https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/ (a 32 bit Debian based Linux for both i386 and ARM)\n\n[^3]: see https://ssw.jku.at/Research/Projects/Oberon.html\n\n\nAn Initial Impression\n---------------------\n\nI first heard of running Ofront/V4 via the ETH Oberon Mail list[^4].\nWhat caught my eye is the reference to running on Raspberry Pi. Prof. Templ \nprovides two flavors of Ofront. One targets the Raspberry Pi OS on ARM\nhardware the second Linux on i386. The Raspberry Pi OS for Intel is an\ni386 variant. I downloaded the tar file, unpacked it and immediately ran\nthe \"oberon.bash\" script provided eager to see a V4 environment. It\nrenders but the fonts rendered terribly slowly. I should have read the\ndocumentation first!  Prof. Templ provides man pages for the tools that\ncome with Ofront including the oberon application. Reading the\nman page for oberon quickly addresses the point of slow font rendering.\nIt also discusses how to convert Oberon fonts to X Windows bitmap fonts.\nIf you use the X Window fonts the V4 environment is very snappy. It does\nrequire that X Windows knows where to find the fonts used in V4. That is\ndone by appending the V4 converted fonts to the X Window font map. I had\ninstalled the Ofront system in my home directory so the command was\n\n```bash\nxset +fp $HOME/ofront_1.4/fonts\n```\n\nRunning \"oberon.bash\" after that immediately improved things. Since I didn't\nneed the Oberon fonts outside of V4 I added the `xset` command to the\n\"oberon.bash\" script just before it invokes the `oberon` command.\n\n[^4]: See Hans Klaver's message: http://lists.inf.ethz.ch/pipermail/oberon/2021/015514.html \n\n\nGoals in my setup\n-----------------\n\nI had three goals in wanting to play with Ofront and running the V4\nOberon.\n\n1. I wanted to work in an Oberon System environment\n2. I need a system meets my vision requirements (e.g. larger font size)\n3. I wanted to understand the Linz/V4 variation in Oberon's evolution\n\nOfront address all three once you get the X Window side setup correctly.\n\nSetting up Ofront and V4\n------------------------\n\nFirst we need to boot up a Raspberry Pi OS device (or an i386 Linux with X11).\nWe need to retrieve the software from Joseph Templ's [software-templ.com](https://software-templ.com).\nTwo 1.4 versions are available precompiled. The first is for ARM running\nRaspberry Pi OS and the second is for generic Linux i386 with X11. I initially\ntested this on an old laptop where running the i386 version of Raspberry Pi OS. \n\nWhat we need\n------------\n\nThe following software is usually already installed on your \nRaspberry Pi OS.\n\n+ curl to download the files[^5]\n+ gunzip to uncompressed the archive file\n+ tar to unpack the archive file\n\n[^5]: If not try `sudo apt install curl` from the command line\n\nWhat we do\n----------\n\n1. Download the appropriate tar file\n    a. ARM: http://www.software-templ.com/shareware/ofront-1.4_raspbian-Pi3.tar.gz\n    b. Intel i386: http://www.software-templ.com/shareware/ofront-1.4_linux-386-3.2.tar.gz\n2. Make sure we can read the compressed archive file\n3. Gunzip and untar the file\n\nHere's the commands I used for the Raspberry Pi hardware.\n\n```bash\n    curl -O http://www.software-templ.com/shareware/ofront-1.4_raspbian-Pi3.tar.gz\n    tar ztvf ofront-1.4_raspbian-Pi3.tar.gz\n    tar zxvf ofront-1.4_raspbian-Pi3.tar.gz\n```\n\nHere's the commands I used for Raspberry Pi OS on Intel\n\n```bash\n    curl -O http://www.software-templ.com/shareware/ofront-1.4_linux-386-3.2.tar.gz\n    tar ztvf ofront-1.4_linux-386-3.2.tar.gz\n    tar zxvf ofront-1.4_linux-386-3.2.tar.gz\n```\n\nAt this point there should be an `ofront_1.4` directory\nwhere you gunziped and untared the archive file. At this point\nyou can test to make sure everything runs by doing the following\n(remember the font rendering with be very slow).\n\n```\n    cd ofront_1.4\n    ./oberon.bash\n```\n\nYou can exit the V4 environment by closing the window or typing\n`System.Quit ~` in an Oberon viewer and middle clicking with your\nmouse[^6].\n\n[^6]: Oberon Systems expect a three button mouse, with a two button mouse you hold the alt key and press the left button. Note that command in Oberon are case sensitive.\n\nThe reason the system is so slow is that X is having to write bitmaps\na pixel at a time in the window holding our Oberon System. What we\nwant X to do is render an X Window font.  Joseph as provided us with\nthe Oberon fonts already converted for X! We just need to let the\nX Window system know where to look.\n\nWhat we need\n------------\n\n+ an editor for editing `oberon.bash`\n\nWhat we'll do\n-------------\n\n1. Exit the running Oberon System using `System.Quit ~` or just close the window\n2. Edit `oberon.bash` to speed up font rendering\n3. Try `oberon.bash` again and see the speed bump\n\nWith your favorite editor add the `xset` line before the `oberon`\ncommand is invoked. My \"oberon.bash\" looks like this.\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -z \"$OFRONT_HOME\" ]; then\n  export OFRONT_HOME=.\n  echo \"OFRONT_HOME set to .\"\nfi\nexport OBERON=.:$OFRONT_HOME/V4_ofront:$OFRONT_HOME/V4:$OFRONT_HOME/fonts\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$OFRONT_HOME/lib\nexport PATH=.:$OFRONT_HOME/bin:$PATH\nxset +fp $HOME/ofront_1.4/fonts\n$OFRONT_HOME/bin/oberon -f ./V4/Big.Map -u 8000 -c $* &\n```\n\nThe `xset` command adds the provided X fonts to X Window. This\nresults in a huge speedup of rendering. I also add the options\nfor using the largest font sizes via a font map file, \"V4/Big.Map\"\nand set the display units to 8000. Your vision or monitor may\nnot need this so you want to only add the line to include the\nX fonts needed by Oberon.\n\nNow re-launch Oberon using the updated \"oberon.bash\" and\nsee the improvement.\n\n```\n    vi oberon.bash\n    ./oberon.bash\n```\n\nYou now have a functioning V4 Oberon System to play with and\nexplore.\n\nThere are some additional POSIX environment setup you can\nadd to improve the integration with your Linux setup. These\nare covered in the man pages for the tools that come with Ofront.\nAdditional information is also provided in the Oberon Texts\nand Tools files in the V4 environment. All are worth reading.\n\n\nWhat does this setup provide?\n-----------------------------\n\nAt the point we have V4 available we have a rich development\nand text environment. One which I feel is conducive to both\nwriting in general and programming specifically. You are running\nunder an adapted Oberon System so there are somethings to consider.\n\nThe Oberon V4 file system does support punctuation characters aside\nfrom periods and slashes.  So when I tried to edit a file with hyphens\nin the name Oberon assumed the filename stopped at the first hyphens.\nThe Oberon file systems are typically case sensitive so this can\nbe worked around with letter case. Of course I could modify the V4\nsystem to allow for more letters too. That's the nice thing about\nhaving the source code.\n\nThe second issue if file format.  In Oberon we can embed fonts\nand coloring and that is treated as normal text. End of line\ncharacters are represented as a carriage return. In POSIX environments\nwe have \"plain text\" without specific font directives and we use\na line feed to terminate lines. Fortunately Prof. Templ provided\na program called `ocat`[^7] that makes short work of converting an\nOberon text into a POSIX friendly format. On the Oberon side of things\nit's also easy because Oberon will treat an ASCII file as a text we\nonly need to convert the line endings and in the Ofront implementation\nof V4 it handles the differences in line endings behind the scenes.\n\nIf you create or store a file in the Oberon environment it'll become\nOberon text. If you need to have a plain text version use `ocat`.\nIf you only read POSIX files in the Oberon environment then they remain\nplain text files but V4 takes care of translating the POSIX line ending\nto ones that are displayed nicely in Oberon.\n\n\n[^7]: In the `ofront_1.4` directory run `man man1/ocat.1` to find out more\n\nWhat to explore next?\n---------------------\n\nNow that we have a fast running V4 system we have some choices\nfor development. Joseph Templ has adapted the display for X\nand also the file system so the files are visible from the Unix\nshell.  This is a powerful arrangement. This supports both Oberon\ndevelopment and the use of Oberon language for the development of\nPOSIX friendly programs.  The Ofront collection provides the\n`ofront` an Oberon-2 to C translator, `ocl` is a tool that will\ncombine `ofront` with your C compiler and linker to produce\nprograms and libraries for Linux. There is also `ocat` for\nconverting Oberon texts to POSIX plain text and `showdef` for\nshowing module definitions.  Finally Ofront provides the\n`oberon` command so we have an Oberon System available as a\ndevelopment environment.\n\nOne thing I recommend exploring is Jospeh Templ's GitHub repository.\nThe makefile provided with the GitHub version assuming an existing\ninstallation of ofront. Since we have one we can compile our own copy\nfrom scratch. If you're running i386 you'll want to look at\n`V4_ofront/linix386` for Pi hardware take a look at `V4_ofront/raspbian`.\n\nHere's how I generated a new version on my Pi hardware.\n\n```\n    git clone https://github.com/jtempl/ofront\n    cd ofront/V4_ofront/raspbian\n    make\n    ./oberon.bash\n```\n\nThere is a note in the README of that directory about finding\n`libX11.so` but I did not need the symbolic link suggested. Since the\nfont path was previously adjusted for the original version I downloaded\nfrom Templ's website I didn't need to add the fonts again. If I fork\nTempl's version or GitHub I will probably update the \"oberon.bash\"\nfile included to check to see if the X fonts are available and if not\nadd them via `xset`. That's on a someday maybe list, for now I am\ncontent exploring the system as is.\n\n\nSomeday, Maybe\n--------------\n\nThings that come to mind after initial exploration include--\n\n- Figure out how to make Atkinson-Hyperlegible[^8] available to V4\n- Replace the X11 integration with SDL 2 integration and run under macOS or Windows\n- Exploring porting V4 to run natively Raspberry Pi via Clang cross compilers\n\nNot sure I'll get the time or have the energy to do these things but\nthey are certainly seem feasible with Ofront as it stands now.\n\n[^8]: See https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont\n\n",

      "content": "\nBeyond Oakwood, Modules and Aliases\n===================================\n\nBy R. S. Doiel, 2021-05-16\n\nOakwood is the name used to refer to an early Oberon language\nstandardization effort in the late 20th century.  It's the name\nof a hotel where compiler developers and the creators of Oberon\nand the Oberon System met to discuss compatibility. The lasting\ninfluence on the 21st century Oberon-07 language can be seen\nin the standard set of modules shipped with POSIX based Oberon-07\ncompilers like\n[OBNC](https://miasap.se/obnc/), [Vishap Oberon Compiler](https://github.com/vishaps/voc) and the \n[Oxford Oberon Compiler](http://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Oxford_Oberon-2_compiler).\n\nThe Oakwood guidelines described a minimum expectation for\na standard set of modules to be shipped with compilers.\nThe modules themselves are minimalist in implementation.\nMinimalism can assist in easing the learning curve\nand encouraging a deeper understanding of how things work.\n\nThe Oberon-07 language is smaller than the original Oberon language\nand the many dialects that followed.  I think of Oberon-07 as the\ndistillation of all previous innovation.  It embodies the\nspirit of \"Simple but not simpler than necessary\". Minimalism is\na fit description of the adaptions of the Oakwood modules for \nOberon-07 in the POSIX environment.\n\n\nWhen simple is too simple\n-------------------------\n\nSometimes I want more than the minimalist module.  A good example\nis standard [Strings](https://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/Strings.def.html)\nmodule.  Thankfully you can augment the standard modules with your own.\nIf you are creative you can even create a drop in replacement.\nThis is what I wound up doing with my \"Chars\" module.\n\nIn the spirit of \"Simple but no simpler\" I originally kept Chars \nvery minimal. I only implemented what I missed most from Strings.\nI got down to a handful of functions for testing characters,\ntesting prefixes and suffixes as well as trim procedures. It was\nall I included in `Chars` was until recently.\n\nOver the last couple of weeks I have been reviewing my own Oberon-07\ncode in my personal projects.  I came to understand that\nin my quest for minimalism I had fallen for \"too simple\".\nThis was evidenced by two observations.  Everywhere I had used\nthe `Strings` module I also included `Chars`. It was boiler plate.\nThe IMPORT sequence was invariably a form of --\n\n~~~\n    IMPORT Strings, Chars, ....\n~~~\n\nOn top of that I found it distracting to see `Chars.*` and `Strings.*`\ncomingled and operating on the same data. If felt sub optimal. It\nfelt baroque. That got me thinking.\n\n> What if Chars included the functionality of Strings?\n\nI see two advantages to merging Chars and Strings. First I\nonly need to include one module instead of two. The second\nis my code becomes more readable. I think that is because\nexpanding Strings to include new procedures and constants allows\nfor both the familiar and for evolution. The problem is renaming\n`Chars.Mod` to `Strings.Mod` implies I'm supplying the standard\n`Strings` module. Fortunately Oberon provides a mechanism for\nsolving this problem. The solution Oberon provides is to allow\nmodule names to be aliased.  Look at my new import statement.\n\n~~~\n    IMPORT Strings := Chars, ...\n~~~\n\nIt is still minimal but at the same time shows `Chars` is going\nto be referenced as `Strings`. By implication `Chars` provides\nthe functionality `Strings` but is not the same as `Strings`.\nMy code reads nicely.  I don't loose the provenance of what\nis being referred to by `Strings` because it is clearly \nprovided in the IMPORT statement.\n\nIn my new [implementation](Chars.Mod) I support all the standard\nprocedures you'd find in an Oakwood compliant `Strings`.  I've\nincluded additional additional constants and functional procedures\nlike `StartsWith()` and `EndsWith()` and a complement of trim\nprocedures like `TrimLeft()`, `TrimRight()`, `Trim()`.\n`TrimPrefix()`, and `TrimSuffix()`.\n\nHere's how `Chars` definition stacks up as rendered by the\nobncdoc tool.\n\n```\n(* Chars.Mod - A module for working with CHAR and \n   ARRAY OF CHAR data types.\n\nCopyright (C) 2020, 2021 R.

Doiel, 2021-06-14\n\nThis post explores integrating C code with an Oberon-07 module use\nMike Spivey's Obc-3 Oberon Compiler.  Last year I wrote a similar post\nfor Karl Landström's [OBNC](/blog/2020/05/01/Combining-Oberon-and-C.html).\nThis goal of this post is to document how I created a version of Karl's\nExtension Library that would work with Mike's Obc-3 compiler.\nIf you want to take a shortcut you can see the results on GitHub\nin my [obc-3-libext](https://github.com/rsdoiel/obc-3-libext) repository.\n\nFrom my time with OBNC I've come to rely on three modules from Karl's\nextension library. When trying to port some of my code to use with\nMike's compiler. That's where I ran into a problem with that dependency.\nKarl's modules aren't available. I needed an [extArgs](http://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/ext/extArgs.def.html),\nan [extEnv](http://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/ext/extEnv.def.html) and\n[extConvert](http://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/ext/extConvert.def.html).\n\nMike's own modules that ship with Obc-3 cover allot of common ground\nwith Karl's. They are organized differently. The trivial solution is\nto implement wrapping modules using Mike's modules for implementation.\nThat takes case of extArgs and extEnv.\n\nThe module extConvert is in a another category. Mike's `Conv` module is\nsignificantly minimalist. To solve that case I've create C code to perform\nthe needed tasks based on Karl's examples and used Mike's share library\ncompilation instructions to make it available inside his run time.\n\nBackground material\n-------------------\n\n- [Obc-3 website](https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Oxford_Oberon-2_compiler)\n    - [Installing Obc-3](https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Installing_OBC_release_3.1)\n    - [Adding primitives to Obc-3](https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/How_to_add_primitives_to_OBC), this is how you extend Obc-3 with C\n    - [Obc-3.1 Manual](https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/wiki/images-corner/c/ce/Obcman-3.1.pdf)\n- [Obc-3 at GitHub](http://github.com/Spivoxity/obc-3)\n\n\nDifferences: OBNC and Obc-3\n---------------------------\n\nThe OBNC compiler written by Karl takes the approach of translating\nOberon-07 code to C and then calling the C tool chain to convert that\ninto a   executable.  Karl's compiler is largely written in C\nwith some parts written in Oberon.\n\nMike's takes a different approach. His compiler uses a run time JIT\nand is written mostly in OCaml with some C parts and shell scripting.\nWhen you compile an Oberon program (either Oberon-2 or Oberon-07) using\nMike's compiler you get a bunch of \"*.k\" files that the object code\nfor Mike's thunder virtual machine and JIT.  This can in turn be used\nto create a executable.\n\nFor implementing Oberon procedures in C Karl's expects an empty\nprocedure body. e.g.\n\n```oberon\nPROCEDURE DoMyThing();\nBEGIN\nEND DoMyThing;\n```\n\nWhile Mike has added a \"IS\" phrase to the procedure signature to\nindicate what the C implementation is known as. There is no procedure\nbody in Mike's implementation and the parameters need to map\ndirectly into a C data type.\n\n```oberon\nPROCEDURE DoMyThing() IS \"do_my_thing\";\n```\n\nOf course both compilers have completely different command line options\nand when you're integrating C shared libraries in Mike's you need to\ncall your local CC (e.g. GCC, clang) to create a share library file.\nMike has extended Oberon-07 SYSTEM to include `SYSTEM.LOADLIB()` which\ntakes a string containing the path to the compiler shared library.\n\nIn Karl's own Oberon-07 modules he uses the `.obn` file extension but\nalso accepts `.Mod`.  In Mike's he uses `.m` and also accepts `.Mod`.\nIn this article I will be using `.m` as that simplified the recipe\nof building and integrating the shared C libraries.\n\n\nSimilarities of OBNC and Obc-3\n------------------------------\n\nBoth compilers provide for compiling Oberon-07 code, Mike's requires\nthe `-07` option to be used to switch from Oberon-2. Both offer the\nability to extend reach into the host POSIX system by wrapping\nC shared libraries. Both run on a wide variety of POSIX systems and\nyou can read the source code at your leisure. This last bit is\nimportant.\n\nArgs, extArgs and extEnv.\n-------------------------\n\nMike provides two features in his Args module. The first is access\nto the command line arguments of the compiled program. The\nsecond feature is to provide access to the host environment variables.\nIn Karl's implementation he separates Mikes `Args.GetEvn()` into\na module called `extEnv`. Here's Mike's module definition looks like ---\n\n```oberon\nDEFINITION Args;\n\nVAR argc* : INTEGER; (* this is equavilent to extArgs.count *)\n\nPROCEDURE GetArg*(n: INTEGER; VAR s: ARRAY OF CHAR);\n\nPROCEDURE GetEnv*(name: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR s: ARRAY OF CHAR);\n\nEND Args.\n```\n\nMy implementation of Karl's `extArgs` needs to look like ---\n\n```oberon\nDEFINITION extArgs;\n\nVAR count*: INTEGER; (* this is the same as Args.argc *)\n\nPROCEDURE Get*(n: INTEGER; VAR arg: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR res: INTEGER);\n\nEND extArgs.\n```\n\nThis leaves us with a very simple module mimicking Karl's.\n\n```oberon\nMODULE extArgs;\n\nIMPORT Args;\n\nVAR\n  count*: INTEGER;\n\nPROCEDURE Get*(n: INTEGER; VAR arg: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR res: INTEGER);\nBEGIN\n  Args.GetArg(n + 1, arg);  res := 0;\nEND Get;\n\nBEGIN\n  count := Args.argc - 1;\nEND extArgs.\n```\n\nNOTE: In Mike's approach the zero-th arg is the program name.\nIn Karl's the zero-th arg is the first argument after the program\nname. To get Karl's behavior with Mike's `GetArg()` I need to\nadjust the offsets.\n\nSo far so good. How about implementing Karl's `extEnv`?\n\nWe've already seen Mike's Args so he doesn't have a matching\ndefinition.  Karl's `extEnv` looks like\n\n```oberon\nDEFINITION extEnv;\n\nPROCEDURE Get*(name: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR value: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR res: INTEGER);\n\nEND extEnv.\n```\n\nAnd again a simple mapping of features and you have\n\n```oberon\nMODULE extEnv;\n\nIMPORT Args, Strings;\n\nPROCEDURE Get*(name : ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR value : ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR res : INTEGER);\n  VAR i, l1, l2 : INTEGER; val : ARRAY 512 OF CHAR;\nBEGIN\n  l1 := LEN(value) - 1; (* Allow for trailing 0X *)\n  Args.GetEnv(name, val);\n  l2 := Strings.Length(val);\n  IF l2 <= l1 THEN\n    res := 0;\n  ELSE\n    res := l2 - l1;\n  END;\n  i := 0;\n  WHILE (i < l2) & (val[i] # 0X) DO\n      value[i] := val[i];\n      INC(i);\n  END;\n  value[i] := 0X;\nEND Get;\n\nEND extEnv.\n```\n\nextConvert requires more work\n-----------------------------\n\nMike provides a module called `Conv.m` for converting numbers\nto strings.  It is a little minimal for my current purpose.\nThat is easy enough to solve as Mike, like Karl provides a means\nof extending Oberon code with C.  That means I need to write\n`extConvert` as both `extConvert.m` (the Oberon-07 part) and\n`extConvert.c` (the C part).\n\nHere's Karl's definition\n\n```oberon\nDEFINITION extConvert;\n\nPROCEDURE IntToString*(i: INTEGER; VAR s: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR done: BOOLEAN);\n\nPROCEDURE RealToString*(x: REAL; VAR s: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR done: BOOLEAN);\n\nPROCEDURE StringToInt*(s: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR i: INTEGER; VAR done: BOOLEAN);\n\nPROCEDURE StringToReal*(s: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR x: REAL; VAR done: BOOLEAN);\n\nEND extConvert.\n```\n\nI have implement my `extConvert` as a hybrid of Oberon-07 and calls\nto a C shared library I will create called `extConvert.c`.\n\nThe Oberon file (i.e. extConvert.m)\n\n```oberon\nMODULE extConvert;\n\nIMPORT SYSTEM;\n\nPROCEDURE IntToString*(i: INTEGER; VAR s: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR done: BOOLEAN);\n  VAR l : INTEGER;\nBEGIN\n  l := LEN(s); done := TRUE;\n  IntToString0(i, s, l);\nEND IntToString;\n\nPROCEDURE IntToString0(i : INTEGER; VAR s : ARRAY OF CHAR; l : INTEGER) IS \"conv_int_to_string\";\n\nPROCEDURE RealToString*(x: REAL; VAR s: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR done: BOOLEAN);\n  VAR l : INTEGER;\nBEGIN\n  l := LEN(s);\n  RealToString0(x, s, l);\nEND RealToString;\n\nPROCEDURE RealToString0(x: REAL; VAR s: ARRAY OF CHAR; l : INTEGER) IS \"conv_real_to_string\";\n\nPROCEDURE StringToInt*(s: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR i: INTEGER; VAR done: BOOLEAN);\nBEGIN\n  done := TRUE;\n  StringToInt0(s, i);\nEND StringToInt;\n\nPROCEDURE StringToInt0(s : ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR i : INTEGER) IS \"conv_string_to_int\";\n\nPROCEDURE StringToReal*(s: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR x: REAL; VAR done: BOOLEAN);\nBEGIN\n  done := TRUE;\n  StringToReal0(s, x);\nEND StringToReal;\n\nPROCEDURE StringToReal0(s: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR x : REAL) IS \"conv_string_to_real\";\n\nBEGIN\n  SYSTEM.LOADLIB(\"./extConvert.so\");\nEND extConvert.\n```\n\nIf you review Mike's module code you'll see I have followed a similar pattern. Before calling out to C I take care of what house keeping I can in Oberon, then I call a \"0\" version of the function implemented in C. The C implementation are not exported only the wrapping Oberon procedures are.\n\nNotice how the initialization block calls `SYSTEM.LOADLIB(\"./extConvert.so\");` this loads the C shared library so that the Oberon module can call out it it.\n\nThe C code in `extConvert.c` looks very traditional without the macros\nyou'd see in OBNC's implementation. Here's what the C code look like.\n\n```C\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid conv_int_to_string(int i, char *s, int l) {\n  snprintf(s, l, \"%d\", i);\n}\n\nvoid conv_real_to_string(float r, char *s, int l) {\n  snprintf(s, l, \"%f\", r);\n}\n\nvoid conv_real_to_exp_string(float r, char *s, int l) {\n  snprintf(s, l, \"%e\", r);\n}\n\nvoid conv_string_to_int(char *s, int *i) {\n    *i = atoi(s);\n}\n\nvoid conv_string_to_real(char *s, float *r) {\n    *r = atof(s);\n}\n```\n\nThe dance to compile the module and C shared library is very different\nbetween OBNC and Obc-3.  With Obc-3 we compile and skip linking\nthe wrapping Oberon module `extConvert.m`. We compile using CC\nour C shared library. We can then put it all together to test\neverything out in `ConvertTest.m`.\n\n```shell\nobc -07 -c extConvert.m\ngcc -fPIC -shared extConvert.c -o extConvert.so\n```\n\nOur test code program looks like.\n\n```oberon\nMODULE ConvertTest;\n\nIMPORT T := Tests, Convert := extConvert;\n\nVAR ts : T.TestSet;\n\nPROCEDURE TestIntConvs() : BOOLEAN;\n  VAR test, ok : BOOLEAN;\n      expectI, gotI : INTEGER;\n      expectS, gotS : ARRAY 128 OF CHAR;\nBEGIN test := TRUE;\n  gotS[0] := 0X; gotI := 0;\n  expectI := 101;\n  expectS := \"101\";\n\n  Convert.StringToInt(expectS, gotI, ok);\n  T.ExpectedBool(TRUE, ok, \"StringToInt('101', gotI, ok) true\", test);\n  T.ExpectedInt(expectI, gotI, \"StringToInt('101', gotI, ok)\", test);\n\n  Convert.IntToString(expectI, gotS, ok);\n  T.ExpectedBool(TRUE, ok, \"IntToString(101, gotS, ok) true\", test);\n  T.ExpectedString(expectS, gotS, \"IntToString(101, gotS, ok)\", test);\n\n  RETURN test\nEND TestIntConvs;\n\nPROCEDURE TestRealConvs() : BOOLEAN;\n  VAR test, ok : BOOLEAN;\n      expectR, gotR : REAL;\n      expectS, gotS : ARRAY 128 OF CHAR;\nBEGIN test := TRUE;\n  gotR := 0.0; gotS[0] := 0X;\n  expectR := 3.1459;\n  expectS := \"3.145900\";\n\n  Convert.StringToReal(expectS, gotR, ok);\n  T.ExpectedBool(TRUE, ok, \"StringToReal('3.1459', gotR, ok) true\", test);\n  T.ExpectedReal(expectR, gotR, \"StringToReal('3.1459', gotR, ok)\", test);\n\n  Convert.RealToString(expectR, gotS, ok);\n  T.ExpectedBool(TRUE, ok, \"RealToString(3.1459, gotS; ok) true\", test);\n  T.ExpectedString(expectS, gotS, \"RealToString(3.1459, gotS, ok)\", test);\n\n  RETURN test\nEND TestRealConvs;\n\nBEGIN\n  T.Init(ts, \"extConvert\");\n  T.Add(ts, TestIntConvs);\n  T.Add(ts, TestRealConvs);\n  ASSERT(T.Run(ts));\nEND ConvertTest.\n```\n\nWe compile and run our test program use the following commands\n(NOTE: Using Obc-3 you list all the dependent modules to possibly\nbe compiled one the command line along with your program module).\n\n```shell\nobc -07 -o converttest extConvert.m Tests.m ConvertTest.m\n./converttest\n```\n\nSource code for these modules is available on GitHub at\n[github.com/rsdoiel/obc-3-libest](https://github.com/rsdoiel/obc-3-libext)\n\n\nNext & Previous\n---------------\n\n- Next [Revisiting Files](../../11/22/Revisiting-Files.html)\n- Previous [Beyond Oakwood, Modules and Aliases](../../05/16/Beyond-Oakwood-Modules-and-Aliases.html)\n",

Doiel, 2021-11-22\n\nIn October I had an Email exchange with Algojack regarding a buggy example in [Oberon-07 and the file system](../../../2020/05/09/Oberon-07-and-the-filesystem.html). The serious bug was extraneous non-printable characters appearing a plain text file containing the string \"Hello World\". The trouble with the example was a result of my misreading the Oakwood guidelines and how **Files.WriteString()** is required to work. The **Files.WriteString()** procedure is supposed to write every element of a string to a file. This __includes the trailing Null character__. The problem for me is **Files.WriteString()** litters plain text files with tailing nulls. What I should have done was write my own **WriteString()** and **WriteLn()**. The program [HelloworldFile](./HelloworldFile.Mod) below is a more appropriate solution to writing strings and line endings than relying directly on **Files**. In a future post I will explorer making this more generalized in a revised \"Fmt\" module.\n\n~~~\nMODULE HelloworldFile;\n\nIMPORT Files, Strings;\n\nCONST OberonEOL = 1; UnixEOL = 2; WindowsEOL = 3;\n\nVAR\n  (* holds the eol marker type to use in WriteLn() *)\n  eolType : INTEGER;\n  (* Define a file handle *)\n    f : Files.File;\n  (* Define a file rider *)\n    r : Files.Rider;\n\nPROCEDURE WriteLn(VAR r : Files.Rider);\nBEGIN\n  IF eolType = WindowsEOL THEN\n    (* A DOS/Windows style line ending, LFCR *)\n    Files.Write(r, 13);\n    Files.Write(r, 10);\n  ELSIF eolType = UnixEOL THEN\n     (* Linux/macOS style line ending, LF *)\n     Files.Write(r, 10);\n  ELSE\n    (* Oberon, RISC OS style line ending, CR *)\n    Files.Write(r, 13);\n  END;\nEND WriteLn;\n\nPROCEDURE WriteString(VAR r : Files.Rider; s : ARRAY OF CHAR);\n  VAR i : INTEGER;\nBEGIN\n  i := 0;\n  WHILE i < Strings.Length(s) DO\n    Files.Write(r, ORD(s[i]));\n    INC(i);\n  END;\nEND WriteString;\n\nBEGIN\n  (* Set the desired eol type to use *)\n  eolType := UnixEOL;\n  (* Create our file, New returns a file handle *)\n  f := Files.New(\"helloworld.txt\"); ASSERT(f # NIL);\n  (* Register our file with the file system *)\n  Files.Register(f);\n  (* Set the position of the rider to the beginning *)\n  Files.Set(r, f, 0);\n  (* Use the rider to write out \"Hello World!\" followed by a end of line *)\n  WriteString(r, \"Hello World!\");\n  WriteLn(r);\n  (* Close our modified file *)\n  Files.Close(f);\nEND HelloworldFile.\n~~~\n\nI have two new procedures \"WriteString\" and \"WriteLn\". These mimic the parameters found in the Files module. The module body is a bit longer.\n\nCompare this to a simple example of \"Hello World\" using the **Out** module.\n\n~~~\nMODULE HelloWorld;\n\nIMPORT Out;\n\nBEGIN\n  Out.String(\"Hello World\");\n  Out.Ln;\nEND HelloWorld.\n~~~\n\nLook at the difference is in the module body. I need to setup our file and rider as well as pick the type of line ending to use in \"WriteLn\". The procedures doing the actual work look very similar, \"String\" versus \"WriteString\" and \"Ln\" versus \"WriteLn\".  \n\n\nLine ends vary between operating systems. Unix-like systems usually use a line feed. DOS/Windows systems use a carriage return and line feed. Oberon Systems use only a carriage return. If we're going to the trouble of re-creating our \"WriteString\" and \"WriteLn\" procedures it also makes sense to handle the different line ending options.  In this case I've chosen to use an INTEGER variable global to the module called \"eolType\". I have a small set of constants to indicate which line ending is needed. In \"WriteLn\" I use that value as a guide to which line ending to use with the rider writing to the file.\n\nThe reason I chose this approach is because I want my writing procedures to use the same procedure signatures as the \"Files\" module. In a future post I will explore type conversion and a revised implementation of my \"Fmt\" module focusing on working with plain text files.\n\nAside from our file setup and picking an appropriate end of line marker the shape of the two programs look very similar.\n\nReferences and resources\n------------------------\n\nYou can see a definition of the [Files](https://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/Files.def.html \"My example module definition is based on the on Karl created in OBNC\") at Karl Landström's documentation for his compiler along with the definitions for [In](https://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/In.def.html) and [Out](https://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/Out.def.html).\n\n\nNext & Previous\n---------------\n\n- Next [Portable Conversions (Integers)](../../11/26/Portable-Conversions-Integers.html)\n- Prev [Combining Oberon-07 with C using Obc-3](../../06/14/Combining-Oberon-07-with-C-using-Obc-3.html)\n",

Doiel, 2021-11-26\n\nAn area in working with Oberon-07 on a POSIX machine that has proven problematic is type conversion. In particular converting to and from INTEGER or REAL and ASCII.  None of the three compilers I am exploring provide a common way of handling this. I've explored relying on C libraries but that approach has it's own set of problems.  I've become convinced a better approach is a pure Oberon-07 library that handles type conversion with a minimum of assumptions about the implementation details of the Oberon compiler or hardware. I'm calling my conversion module \"Types\". The name is short and descriptive and seems an appropriate name for a module consisting of type conversion tests and transformations.  My initial implementation will focusing on converting integers to and from ASCII.\n\nINTEGER to ASCII and back again\n-------------------------------\n\nI don't want to rely on the representation of the INTEGER value in the compiler or at the machine level. That has lead me to think in terms of an INTEGER as a signed whole number. \n\nThe simplest case of converting to/from ASCII is the digits from zero to nine (inclusive). Going from an INTEGER to an ASCII CHAR is just looking up the offset of the character representing the \"digit\". Like wise going from ASCII CHAR to a INTEGER is a matter of mapping in the reverse direction.  Let's call these procedures `DigitToChar` and  `CharToDigit*`.\n\nSince INTEGER can be larger than zero through nine and CHAR can hold non-digits I'm going to add two additional procedures for validating inputs -- `IsIntDigit` and `IsCharDigit`. Both return TRUE if valid, FALSE if not.\n\nFor numbers larger than one digit I can use decimal right shift to extract the ones column value or a left shift to reverse the process.  Let's called these `IntShiftRight` and `IntShiftLeft`.  For shift right it'd be good to capture the ones column being lost. For shift left it would be good to be able to shift in a desired digit. That way you could shift/unshift to retrieve to extract and put back values.\n\nA draft definition for \"Types\" should look something like this.\n\n~~~\nDEFINITION Types;\n\n(* Check if an integer is a single digit, i.e. from 0 through 9 returns\n   TRUE, otherwise FALSE *)\nPROCEDURE IsIntDigit(x : INTEGER) : BOOLEAN;\n\n(* Check if a CHAR is \"0\" through \"9\" and return TRUE, otherwise FALSE *)\nPROCEDURE IsCharDigit(ch : CHAR) : BOOLEAN;\n\n(* Convert digit 0 through 9 into an ASCII CHAR \"0\" through \"9\",\n   ok is TRUE if conversion successful, FALSE otherwise *)\nPROCEDURE DigitToChar(x : INTEGER; VAR ch : CHAR; VAR ok : BOOLEAN);\n\n(* Convert a CHAR \"0\" through \"9\" into a digit 0 through 9, ok\n   is TRUE is conversion successful, FALSE otherwise *)\nPROCEDURE CharToDigit(ch : CHAR; VAR x : INTEGER; VAR ok : BOOLEAN);\n\n(* Shift an integer to the right (i.e. x * 0.1) set \"r\" to the\n   value shifted out (ones column lost) and return the shifted value.\n   E.g.  x becomes 12, r becomes 3.\n\n       x := IntShiftRight(123, r);\n   \n *)\nPROCEDURE IntShiftRight(x : INTEGER; VAR r : INTEGER) : INTEGER;\n\n(* Shift an integer to the left (i.e. x * 10) adding the value y\n   after the shift.\n\n   E.g. x before 123\n\n       x := IntShiftRight(12, 3);\n\n *)\nPROCEDURE IntShiftLeft(x, y : INTEGER) : INTEGER;\n\n(* INTEGER to ASCII *)\nPROCEDURE Itoa(src : INTEGER; VAR value : ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR ok : BOOLEAN);\n\n(* ASCII to INTEGER *)\nPROCEDURE Atoi(src : ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR value : INTEGER; VAR ok : BOOLEAN);\n\nEND Types.\n~~~\n\n\nNOTE: Oberon-07 provides us the ORD and CHR built as part of the\nlanguage.  These are for working with the encoding and decoding\nvalues as integers. This is not the same thing as the meaning\nof \"0\" versus the value of 0.  Getting to and from the encoding\nto the meaning of the presentation can be done with some simple\narithmetic.\n\nPutting it all together\n-----------------------\n\n~~~\n(* DigitToChar converts an INTEGER less than to a character. E.g.\n   0 should return \"0\", 3 returns \"3\", 0 returns \"9\" *)\nPROCEDURE DigitToChar*(i : INTEGER) : CHAR;\nBEGIN\n  RETURN (CHR(ORD(\"0\") + i))\nEND DigitToChar;\n\n(* CharToDigit converts a single \"Digit\" character to an INTEGER value.\n   E.g. \"0\" returns 0, \"3\" returns 3, \"9\" returns 9. *)\nPROCEDURE CharToDigit(ch : CHAR) : INTEGER;\nBEGIN\n  RETURN (ORD(ch) - ORD(\"0\"))\nEND CharToDigit;\n~~~\n\nThis implementation is naive. It assumes the ranges of the input values\nwas already checked. In practice this is going to encourage bugs.\n\nIn a language like Go or Python you can return multiple values (in\nPython you can return a tuple). In Oberon-07 I could use a\nRECORD type to do that but that feels a little too baroque. Oberon-07\nlike Oberon-2, Oberon, Modula and Pascal does support \"VAR\" parameters. \nWith a slight modification to our procedure signatures I can support\neasy assertions about the conversion. Let's create two functional\nprocedures `IsIntDigit()` and `IsCharDigit()` then update our\n`DigitToChar()` and `CharToDigit()` with an a  \"VAR ok : BOOLEAN\"\nparameter.\n\n~~~\n(* IsIntDigit returns TRUE is the integer value is zero through nine *)\nPROCEDURE IsIntDigit(i : INTEGER) : BOOLEAN;\nBEGIN \n  RETURN ((i >= 0) & (i <= 9))\nEND IsIntDigit;\n\n(* IsCharDigit returns TRUE if character is zero through nine. *)\nPROCEDURE IsCharDigit(ch : CHAR) : BOOLEAN;\nBEGIN\n  RETURN ((ch >= \"0\") & (ch <= \"9\"))\nEND IsCharDigit;\n\n(* DigitToChar converts an INTEGER less than to a character. E.g.\n   0 should return \"0\", 3 returns \"3\", 0 returns \"9\" *)\nPROCEDURE DigitToChar*(i : INTEGER; VAR ok : BOOLEAN) : CHAR;\nBEGIN\n  ok := IsIntDigit(i);\n  RETURN (CHR(ORD(\"0\") + i))\nEND DigitToChar;\n\n(* CharToDigit converts a single \"Digit\" character to an INTEGER value.\n   E.g. \"0\" returns 0, \"3\" returns 3, \"9\" returns 9. *)\nPROCEDURE CharToDigit(ch : CHAR; VAR ok : BOOLEAN) : INTEGER;\nBEGIN\n  ok := IsCharDigit(ch);\n  RETURN (ORD(ch) - ORD(\"0\"))\nEND CharToDigit;\n~~~\n\nWhat about values are greater nine? Here we can take advantage\nof our integer shift procedures.  `IntShiftRight` will move the\nINTEGER value right reducing it's magnitude (i.e. x * 0.1). It\nalso captures the ones column lost in the shift.  Repeatedly calling\n`IntShiftRight` will let us peal off the ones columns until the\nvalue \"x\" is zero. `IntShiftLeft` shifts the integer to the\nleft meaning it raises it a magnitude (i.e. x * 10). `IntShiftLeft`\nalso rakes a value to shift in on the right side of the number.\nIn this way we can shift in a zero and get `x * 10` or shift in\nanother digit and get `(x * 10) + y`. This means you can use\n`IntShiftRight` and recover an `IntShiftLeft`.\n\n~~~\n\n(* IntShiftRight converts the input integer to a real, multiplies by 0.1\n   and converts by to an integer. The value in the ones column is record\n   in the VAR parameter r.  E.g. IntShiftRight(123) return 12, r is set to 3. *)\nPROCEDURE IntShiftRight*(x : INTEGER; VAR r : INTEGER) : INTEGER;\n  VAR i : INTEGER; isNeg : BOOLEAN;\nBEGIN\n  isNeg := (x < 0);\n  i := FLOOR(FLT(ABS(x)) * 0.1);\n  r := ABS(x) - (i * 10);\n  IF isNeg THEN\n    i := i * (-1);\n  END;\n  RETURN i\nEND IntShiftRight;\n\n(* IntShiftLeft multiples input value by 10 and adds y.

So I've chosen to capture the sign in the `isNeg` variable. This lets me work with the absolute value for the actual conversion.  One failing in this implementation is I don't detect an overflow.  Also notice that I am accumulating the individual column values in reverse order (lowest magnitude first).  That is what I need a temporary buffer. I can then copy the values in reverse order into the VAR ARRAY OF CHAR. Finally I also maintain the ok BOOLEAN to track if anything went wrong.\n\nWhen moving from an ASCII representation I can simplified the code by having a local (to the module) procedure for generating magnitudes.\n\nGoing the other way I can simplify my `Atoi` if I have an local to the module \"magnitude\" procedure.\n\n~~~\n\n(* magnitude takes x and multiplies it be 10^y, If y is positive zeros\n   are appended to the right side (i.e. multiplied by 10). If y is\n   negative then the result is shifted left (i.e.. multiplied by\n   0.1 via IntShiftRight().).  The digit(s) shift to the fractional\n   side of the decimal are ignored. *)\nPROCEDURE magnitude(x, y : INTEGER) : INTEGER;\n  VAR z, w : INTEGER;\nBEGIN\n  z := 1;\n  IF y >= 0 THEN\n    WHILE y > 0 DO\n      z := IntShiftLeft(z, 0);\n      DEC(y);\n    END;\n  ELSE\n    WHILE y < 0 DO\n      x := IntShiftRight(x, w);\n      INC(y);\n    END;\n  END;\n  RETURN (x * z)\nEND magnitude;\n\n~~~\n\nAnd with that I can put together my `Atoi` (ASCII to integer) procedure.  I'll need to add some sanity checks as well.\n\n~~~\n\n(* Atoi converts an ASCII string to a signed integer value\n   setting the ok BOOLEAN to TRUE on success and FALSE on error. *)\nPROCEDURE Atoi*(source : ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR value : INTEGER; VAR ok : BOOLEAN);\n  VAR i, l, a, m: INTEGER; isNeg : BOOLEAN;\nBEGIN\n  (* \"i\" is the current CHAR position we're analyzing, \"l\" is the\n     length of our string, \"a\" holds the accumulated value,\n     \"m\" holds the current magnitude we're working with *)\n  i := 0; l := Strings.Length(source);\n  a := 0; m := l - 1; isNeg := FALSE; ok := TRUE;\n  (* Validate magnitude and sign behavior *)\n  IF (l > 0) & (source[0] = \"-\") THEN\n    INC(i); DEC(m);\n    isNeg := TRUE;\n  ELSIF (l > 0) & (source[0] = \"+\") THEN\n    INC(i); DEC(m);\n  END;\n\n  (* The accumulator should always hold a positive integer, if the\n     sign flips we have overflow, ok should be set to FALSE *)\n  ok := TRUE;\n  WHILE (i < l) & ok DO\n    a := a + magnitude(CharToDigit(source[i], ok), m);\n    IF a < 0 THEN\n      ok := FALSE; (* we have an overflow condition *)\n    END;\n    DEC(m);\n    INC(i);\n  END;\n  IF ok THEN\n    IF (i = l) THEN\n      IF isNeg THEN\n        value := a * (-1);\n      ELSE\n        value := a;\n      END;\n    END;\n  END;\nEND Atoi;\n\n~~~\n\nHere's an example using the procedures.\n\nConverting an integer 1234 to an string \"1234\".\n\n~~~\n\n   x := 1234; s := \"\"; ok := FALSE;\n   Types.Itoa(x, s, ok);\n   IF ok THEN \n     Out.String(s); Out.String(\" = \");\n     Out.Int(x,1);Out.Ln;\n   ELSE\n     Out.String(\"Something went wrong\");Out.Ln;\n   END;\n\n~~~\n\nConverting a string \"56789\" to integer 56789.\n\n~~~\n\n   x := 0; src := \"56789\"; ok := FALSE;\n   Types.Atoi(src, x, ok);\n   IF ok THEN \n     Out.Int(x,1); Out.String(\" = \"); Out.String(s); \n     Out.Ln;\n   ELSE\n     Out.String(\"Something went wrong\");Out.Ln;\n   END;\n\n~~~\n\n\nReferences and resources\n------------------------\n\nImplementations for modules for this article are linked here [Types](./Types.Mod), [TypesTest](./TypesTest.Mod) and [Tests](./Tests.Mod). \n\nExpanded versions of the `Types` module will be available as part of Artemis Project -- [github.com/rsdoiel/Artemis](https://github.com/rsdoiel/Artemis).\n\nPrevious\n--------\n\n- [Revisiting Files](../../11/22/Revisiting-Files.html)\n\n\n",

Doiel, 2021-11-27\n\nIn this article I'm going explore setting up FreeDOS with Qemu\non my venerable Dell 4319 running Raspberry Pi Desktop OS (Debian\nGNU/Linux).  First step is to download FreeDOS \"Live CD\" in the\n1.3 RC4 release. See http://freedos.org/download/ for that.\n\nInstalling Qemu\n---------------\n\nI needed to install Qemu in my laptop. It runs the Raspberry Pi\nDesktop OS (i.e. Debian with Raspberry Pi UI). I choose to install\nthe \"qemu-system\" package since I will likely use qemu for other\nthings besides FreeDOS. The qemu-system package contains all the\nvarious systems I might want to emulate in other projects as well\nas several qemu utilities that are handy.  Here's the full sequence\nof `apt` commands I ran (NOTE: these included making sure my laptop\nwas up to date before I installed qemu-system).\n\n~~~\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\nsudo apt install qemu-system\n~~~\n\nNow that I had the software available it was time to figure out\nhow to actually knit things together and run FreeDOS.\n\n\nObtaining FreeDOS 1.3rc4\n------------------------\n\nBefore I get started I create a folder in my home directory\nfor running everything. You can name it what you want\nbut I called mine `FreeDOS_13` and changed into that folder\nfor the work in this article.\n\n~~~\nmkdir FreeDOS_13\ncd FreeDOS_13\n~~~\n\nI initially tried the CD images but ran into odd problems with\nqemu (possibly due to my lack of experience with qemu).\nAfter looking at that various options the USB Full release\nseemed like a good choice. It comes both as an image you can\n\"burn\" to your USB drive both also as a \"vmdk\" file used with\nemulators.\n\n~~~\ncurl -L -O https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.3/previews/1.3-rc4/FD13-FullUSB.zip\nunzip FD13-FullUSB.zip\n~~~\n\nAt this point you should see the FreeDOS \"vmdk\" file, and \"img\" file and readme files if you list the directory out. I'm going to use the \"vmdk\" file to install FreeDOS on my virtual harddrive freedos.img.\n\n~~~\nls -l \n~~~\n\nPrepping my virtual machine\n---------------------------\n\nA virtual machine is not just a CPU and some random\naccess memory. A machine can include storage devices. For\nthe retro \"DOS\" experience you might looking virtual devices\nfor a \"harddrive\", \"floppy drive\" and \"CD-ROM drive\". \nQemu provides a tool called `qemu-img` for creating \nthese types of virtual devices.\n\nThe basic command is `qemu-img` using the \"create\" option with\nsome parameters.  The parameter are filename and size (see\n`man qemu-img` for gory details). I am calling my virtual\nharddrive \"freedos.img\".  With `qemu-img` the size can be\nspecified with a suffix like \"K\" for kilobytes,  \"M\" for\nmegabytes and \"G\" for gigabytes. DOS is a minimal requirements\na small (by today's standards) 750 megabyte harddrive seems\nappropriate.\n\n~~~\nqemu-img create freedos.img 750M\n~~~\n\nFor my purposes I need a harddrive so I stopped there. You\ncan always create other drives and then restart your virtual\nmachine with the appropriate options.\n\nBring up my FreeDOS box\n-----------------------\n\nNow I was ready to boot from installation media and install\nFreeDOS 1.3rc4 on my virtual harddrive.  For that I\nuse a \"qemu\" command for the system I want to emulate.\nI picked `qemu-system-i386` (see can see\nthe gory details of that command using `man qemu-system-i386`).\nTo install FreeDOS I'm going to boot from the vmdk file \nprovided for the purpose of installation. I then use the FreeDOS\ninstaller to make my freedos.img file bootable with all the\nDOS software I want to play with.\n\n~~~\nqemu-system-i386 \\\n   -m 8 \\\n   -boot menu=on,strict=on \\\n   -hda freedos.img \\\n   -hdb FD13FULL.vmdk\n~~~\n\nAt this point you should see the machine start to boot, press Esc\nwhen prompted and select the second hard drive to boot from (that's\nour vmdk drive).  The drive is then treated like the CD-ROM, follow\nthe programs instructions for installation. You will need to reboot\nseveral times during the process.

It was in good condition but lacked an OS on the hard drive.  I used a previously purchased copy of Mac OS X Snow Leopard to get an OS up and running on the bare hardware. Then it was a longer effort to get the machine into a state with the software I wanted to use on it. My goal was Mac OS X High Sierra, Xcode 10.1 and Mac Ports. The process was straight forward but very time consuming but I think worth it.  I wound up with a nice machine for experimenting with and writing blog posts.\n\nThe setup process was as follows:\n\n1. Install macOS Snow Leopard on the bare disk of the Mac Mini\n2. Install macOS El Capitan on the Mac Mini after manually downloading it from Apple's support site\n3. Run updates indicated by El Capitan\n4. Install macOS High Sierra on the Mac Mini after manually downloading it from the Apple's support site\n5. Run updates indicated by High Sierra \n6. Manually download and install Xcode 10.1 command line tools \n7. Check and run some updates again\n8. Finally install Mac Ports\n\nThe OS installs took about 45 minutes to 90 minutes each. Installing Xcode took about 45 minutes to an hour. Installing Mac Ports was fast as was installing software via Mac Ports.\n\nReference material\n------------------\n\n- Apple support pages that I found helpful\n    - [How to get old versions of macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683)\n    - [How to create a bootable installer for macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372)\n    - [macOS High Sierra - Technical Specifications](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP765?locale=en_US)\n- Wikipedia page on [Xcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode) is how I sorta out what version of Xcode I needed to install\n- Links to old macOS and Xcode\n    - Download [Mac OS X El El Capitan](http://updates-http.cdn-apple.com/2019/cert/061-41424-20191024-218af9ec-cf50-4516-9011-228c78eda3d2/InstallMacOSX.dmg)\n    - Download [Mac OX X High Sierra](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?mt=12)\n    - Download [Xcode 10.1](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode), Scroll down the list until you want it.\n        - [Command Line Tools (macOS 10.13) for Xcode 10.1](https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Command_Line_Tools_macOS_10.13_for_Xcode_10.1/Command_Line_Tools_macOS_10.13_for_Xcode_10.1.dmg)\n        - NOTE: There are two version available, you want the version for macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) NOT Mac OS 10.14.\n\n",

      "content": "\nArtemis Project Status, 2022\n============================\n\nIt's been a while since I wrote an Oberon-07 post and even longer since I've worked on Artemis. Am I done with Oberon-07 and abandoning Artemis?  No. Life happens and free time to just hasn't been available. I don't know when that will change.\n\nWhat's the path forward?\n------------------------\n\nSince I plan to continue working Artemis I need to find a way forward in much less available time. Time to understand some of my constraints. \n\n1. I work on a variety of machines, OBNC is the only compiler I've consistently been able to use across all my machines\n2. Porting between compilers takes energy and time, and those compilers don't work across all my machines\n3. When I write Oberon-07 code I quickly hit a wall for the things I want to do, this is what original inspired Artemis, so there is still a need for a collection of modules\n4. Oberon/Oberon-07 on Wirth RISC virtual machine is not sufficient for my development needs\n5. A2, while very impressive, isn't working for me either (mostly because I need to work on ARM CPUs)\n\nThese constraints imply Artemis is currently too broadly scoped. I think I need to focus on what works in OBNC for now. Once I have a clear set of modules then I can revisit portability to other compilers.\n\nWhat modules do I think I need? If I look at my person projects I tend to work allot with text, often structured text (e.g. XML, JSON, CSV). I also tend to be working with network services. Occasionally I need to interact with database (e.g. SQLite3, MySQL, Postgres).  Artemis should provide modules to make it easy to write code in Oberon-07 that works in those areas. Some of that I can do by wrapping existing C libraries. Some I can simply write from scratch in Oberon-07 (e.g. a JSON encoder/decoder). That's going to me my focus as my hobby time becomes available and then.\n\n\n",

      "content": "\nTurbo Oberon, the dream\n=======================\n\nby R. S. Doiel, 2022-07-30\n\nSometimes I have odd dreams and that was true last night through early this morning. The dream was set in the future. I was already retired. It was a dream about \"Turbo Oberon\".\n\n\"Turbo Oberon\" was an Oberon language. The language compiler was named \"TO\" in my dream. A module's file extension was \".tom\", in honor of Tom Lopez (Meatball Fulton) of ZBS. There were allot of ZBS references in the dream.\n\n\"TO\" was very much a language in the Oberon-07 tradition with minor extensions when it came to bringing in modules. It allowed for a multi path search for module names. You could also express a Module import as a string allowing providing paths to the imported module.\n\nCompilation was similar to Go. Cross compilation was available out of the box by setting a few environment variables. I remember answering questions about the language and its evolution. I remember mentioning in the conversation about how I thought Go felling into the trap of complexity like Rust or C/C++ before it. The turning point for Go was generics. Complexity was the siren song to be resisted in \"Turbo Oberon\". Complexity is seductive to language designers and implementers. I was only an implementer.\n\nEvolution wise \"TO\" was built initially on the Go tool chain. As a result it featured easily cross-compiled binaries and had a rich standard set of Modules like Go but also included portable libraries for implementing graphic user interfaces. \"Turbo Oberon\" evolved as a conversation between Go and the clean simplicity of Oberon-07. Two example applications \"shipped\" with the \"TO\" compiler. They were an Oberon like Operating System (stand alone and hosted) and a Turbo Pascal like IDE. The IDE was called \"toe\" for Turbo Oberon Editor. I don't remember the name of the OS implementation but it might have been \"toos\". I remember \"TO\" caused problems for search engines and catalog systems.\n\nI remember remarking in the dream that programming in \"Turbo Oberon\" was a little like returning to my roots when I first learned to program in Turbo Pascal. Except I could run my programs regardless of the operating system or CPU architecture. \"\"TO\" compiler supported cross compilation for Unix, macOS, Windows on ARM, Intel, RISC-V. The targets were inherited from Go implementation roots.\n\nIn my dream I remember forking Go 1.18 and first replacing the front end of the compiler. I remember it was a challenge understanding the implementation and generate a Go compatible AST. The mapping between Oberon-07 and Go had its challenges. I remember first sticking to a strict Oberon-07 compiler targeting POSIX before enhancing module imports. I remember several failed attempts at getting module imports \"right\". I remember being on the fence about a map data type and going with a Maps module.  I don't remember how introspection worked but saying it was based on an ETH paper for Oberon 2.  I remember the compiler, like Go, eventually became self hosting. It supported a comments based DSL to annotating RECORD types making encoding and decoding convenient, an influence of Go and it's tool chain.\n\nI believe the \"Turbo Oberon Editor\" came first and that was followed by the operating system implementation.\n\nI remember talking about a book that influenced me called, \"Operating Systems through compilers\" but don't know who wrote it. I remember a discussion about the debt owed to Prof. Wirth. I remember that the book showed how once you really understood building the compile you could then build the OS. There was a joke riffing on the old Lisp joke but rephrased, \"all applications evolve not to a Lisp but to an embedded OS\".\n\nIt was a pleasant dream, in the dream I was older and already retired but still writing \"TO\" code and having fun with computers. I remember a closing video shot showing me typing away at what looked like the old Turbo Pascal IDE. As Mojo Sam said in **Somewhere Next Door to Reality**, \"it was a sorta a retro future\".\n",
