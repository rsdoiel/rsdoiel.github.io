<h1 id="go-bleve-and-library-oriented-software">Go, Bleve and Library
oriented software</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2018-02-19 (updated: 2018-02-22)</p>
<p>In 2016, Stephen Davison, asked me, “Why use Go and Blevesearch for
our library projects?” After our conversation I wrote up some notes so I
would remember. It is now 2018 and I am revising these notes. I think
our choice paid off. What follows is the current state of my reflection
on the background, rational, concerns, and risk mitigation strategies so
far for using <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> and <a
href="https://blevesearch.com">Blevesearch</a> for Caltech Library
projects.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I first came across Go a few years back when it was announced as an
Open Source project by Google at an Google I/O event (2012). The
original Go authors were Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
What I remember from that presentation was Go was a rather consistent
language with the features you need but little else. Go developed at
Google as a response to high development costs for C/C++ and Java in
addition to challenges with performance and slow compilation times. As a
language I would put Go between C/C++ and Java. It comes the ease of
writing and reading you find in languages like Python. Syntax is firmly
in the C/C++ family but heavily simplified. Like Java it provides many
modern features including rich basic data structures and garbage
collection. It has a very complete standard library and provides very
good tooling. This makes it easy to generate code level documentation,
format code, test, efficiently profile, and debug.</p>
<p>Often programming languages develop around a specific set of needs.
This is true for Go. Given the Google origin it should not be surprising
to find that Go’s primary strengths are working with structured data,
I/O and concurrency. The rich standard library is organized around a
package concept. These include packages supporting network protocols,
file and socket I/O as well as various encoding and compression scheme.
It has particularly strong support for XML, JSON, CSV formatted data out
of the box. It has a template library for working with plain text
formats as well as generating safe HTML. You can browse Go’s standard
library https://golang.org/pkg/.</p>
<p>An additional feature is Go’s consistency. Go code that compiles
under version 1.0 still compiles under 1.10. Even before 1.0 code
changes that were breaking came with tooling to automatically updates
existing code. Running code is a strong element of Go’s evolution.</p>
<p>Go is unsurprising and has even been called boring. This turns out to
be a strength when building sustainable projects in a small team.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-write-go">Why do I write Go?</h2>
<p>For me Go is a good way to write web services, assemble websites,
create search appliances and write command line (cli) utilities. When a
shell script becomes unwieldy Go is often what I turn to. Go is well
suited to building tools as well as systems. Go based command line tools
are very easy to orchestrate with shell and Python.</p>
<p>Go runs on all the platforms I actively use - Windows, Mac OS X,
Linux on both Intel and ARM (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Pine64). It has
experimental support for Android and iOS. I’ve used a tool called <a
href="http://gopherjs.org">GopherJS</a> to write web browser
applications that transform my command line tools into web tools with a
friendlier user interface (see our <a
href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/bibtex/webapp/">BibTeX
Tools</a>).</p>
<p>Go supports cross compiling out of the box. This means a production
system running on AWS, Google’s compute engine or Microsoft’s Azure can
be compiled from Windows, Mac OS or even a Raspberry Pi! Deployment is a
matter of copying the (self contained) compiled binary onto the
production system. This contrasts with other platforms like Perl, PHP,
Python, NodeJS and Ruby where you need to install not only your
application code but all dependencies. While interpretive languages
retain an advantage of having a REPL, Go based programs have advantages
of fast compile times and easy deployment.</p>
<p>In many of the projects I’ve written in Go I’ve only required a few
(if any) 3rd party libraries (packages in Go’s nomenclature). This is
quite a bit different from my experience with Perl, PHP, Python, NodeJS
and Ruby. This is in large part a legacy of having grown up at Google
before become an open source project. While the Go standard packages are
very good there is a rich ecosystem for 3rd party packages for
specialized needs. I’ve found I tend to rely only on a few of them. The
one I’ve used the most is <a
href="http://blevesearch.com">Bleve</a>.</p>
<p>Bleve is a Go package for building search engines. When I originally
came across Bleve (around 2014), it was described as “Lucene lite”.
“Lucene lite” was an apt description, but I find it easier to use than
Lucene. When I first used Bleve I embedded its functionality into the
tools I used to process data and present web services. It did not have
much in the way of stand alone command line tooling. Today I
increasingly think of Bleve as “Elastic Search lite”. It ships with a
set of command line tools that include support for building Bleve’s
indexes. My current practice is to only embed the search portion of the
packages. I can use the Bleve command line for the rest. In 2018, Bleve
is being actively developed, has a small vibrant community and is used
by <a href="https://couchbase.com">Couchbase</a>, a well established
NoSQL player.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-using-go">Who is using Go?</h2>
<p>Many companies use Go. The short list includes Google, Amazon,
Netflix, Dropbox, Box, eBay, Pearsons and even Walmart and Microsoft.
This came to my attention at developer conferences back in 2014. People
from many of these companies started presenting at conferences on pilot
projects that had been successful and moved to production. Part of what
drove adoption was the ease of development in Go along with good system
performance. I also think there was a growing disenchantment with
alternatives like C++, C sharp and Java as well as the weight of the
LAMP, Tomcat, and OpenStack.</p>
<p>Highly visible Go based projects include</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docker.org">Docker</a> and <a
href="http://www.docker.com">Rocket</a> - Containerization for running
process in the cloud</li>
<li><a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernettes</a> and <a
href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> - Container orchestration
systems</li>
<li><a href="http://hugo.io">Hugo</a> - the fast/popular static website
generator, an alternative to Jekyll, for those who want speed</li>
<li><a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> - a Go based web server
trying to unseat Apache/NGinX focusing on easy of use plus speed</li>
<li><a href="http://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> - a cutting edge distributed
storage system based on block chains</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-is-using-blevesearch">Who is using Blevesearch?</h3>
<p>Here’s some larger projects using Bleve.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.couchbase.com">Couchbase</a>, a NoSQL database
platform are replacing Lucene with Bleve. Currently the creator of Bleve
works for them.</li>
<li><a href="http://hugo.io">Hugo</a> can integrate with Bleve for
search and index generation</li>
<li><a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> integrates with Bleve
to provide an embedded search capability</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="managing-risks">Managing risks</h2>
<p>In 2014 Go was moving from bleeding to leading edge. Serious capital
was behind its adoption and it stopped being an exotic conference item.
In 2014 Bleve was definitely bleeding edge. By late 2015 and early 2016
the program level API stabilized. People were piloting projects with it.
This included our small group at Caltech Library. In 2015 non-English
language support appeared followed by a growing list of non-European
languages in 2016. By mid 2016 we started to see missing features like
alternative sorting added. While Bleve isn’t yet 1.0 (Feb. 2018) it is
reliable. The primary challenge for the Bleve project is documentation
targeting the novice and non-Programmer users. Bleve has proven
effective as an indexing and search platform for archival, library, and
data repository content.</p>
<p>Adopting new software comes with risk. We have mitigated this in two
ways.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Identify alternative technology (a plan B)</li>
<li>Architect our systems for easy decomposition and re-composition</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of Go, packages can be compiled to a C-Shared library.
This allows us to share working Go packages with languages like Python,
R, and PHP. We have included shared Go/Python modules on our current
road map for projects.</p>
<p>For Blevesearch the two alternatives are Solr and Elastic Search.
Both are well known, documented, and solid. The costs would be
recommitting to a Java stack and its resource requirements. We have
already identified what we want to index and that could be converted to
either platform if needed. If we stick with Go but dropped Blevesearch
we would swap out the Bleve specific code for Go packages supporting
Solr and Elastic Search.</p>
<p>The greatest risk in adopting Go for library and archive projects was
knowledge transfer. We addressed this by knowledge sharing and insuring
the Go codebase can be used via command line programs. Additionally we
are adding support for Go based Python modules. Training also is
available in the form of books, websites and online courses (<a
href="https://www.lynda.com/Go-tutorials/Up-Running-Go/412378-2.html">lynda.com</a>
offers a “Up Running Go” course).</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits">What are the benefits?</h2>
<p>For library and archives software we have found Go’s benefits include
improved back end systems performance at a lower cost, ease of
development, ease of deployment, a rich standard library focused on the
types of things needed in library and archival software. Go plays nice
with other systems (e.g. I create an API based service in Go that can
easily be consumed by a web browser running JavaScript or
Perl/PHP/Python code running under LAMP). In the library and archives
setting Go can become a high performance duck tape. We get the
performance and reliability of C/Java type systems with code simplicity
similar to Python.</p>
