<h1 id="review-software-tools-in-pascal">Review: Software Tools in
Pascal</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2018-07-22 (updated: 2018-07-22, 1:39 pm, PDT)</p>
<p>This book is by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger. It is an
example of the type of books I find I re-read and want in my personal
library. The book covers software construction through a series of
programs written in pascal. It is about how these programs work, how to
approach problems and write sound software. I was surprised I did not
know about this book when I was browsing the <a
href="https://openlibrary.org">Open Library</a> this weekend. While
Pascal was a popular in the 1980’s it has faded for most people in the
early 21st century. This review maybe a small bit of nostalgia. On the
other hand I suspect <a
href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL4258115M/Software_tools_in_Pascal">“Software
Tools in Pascal”</a> is one of the short list of computer books that
will remain useful over the long run.</p>
<h2 id="whats-covered">What’s covered</h2>
<p>The book is organized around specific programs and their
implementations. The implementations provided are simple and straight
forward. Each section is followed by a set of “exercises” that extend
the ideas shown in the section. In this way you could derive the modern
equivalent of these tools.</p>
<p>The topics you build tools for in the text are filters, files,
sorting, text patterns, editing, formatting, and macro processing.</p>
<p>If you want to follow the book along in Pascal then I think Free
Pascal available in many Debian distributions including Raspbian on the
Raspberry Pi is a good choice. Likewise Wirth’s Pascal is easy enough to
port to other languages and indeed this would be a useful exercise when
I re-read the book the next time.</p>
<p>The book presents a very nice set of text oriented programs to
explore programming or re-connect with your programming roots.</p>
