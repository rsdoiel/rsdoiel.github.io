<h1 id="wish-list-for-oberon-in-2023">Wish list for Oberon in 2023</h1>
<p>Next year will be ten years since Prof. Wirth and Paul Reed released
<a href="https://www.projectoberon.com">Project Oberon 2013</a>. It took
me most of that decade to stumble on the project and community. I am
left wondering if Prof. Wirth and Paul Reed sat down today what would
they design? I think only minor changes are needed and those mostly
around assumptions.</p>
<h2 id="oberon-07-changing-assumptions">Oberon-07 changing
assumptions</h2>
<p>The language of Oberon-07 doesn’t need to change. I do think the
assumptions of the compiler are worth revisiting. A CHAR should not be
assumed to be an eight bit byte. A CHAR should represent a character or
symbol in a language. Many if not most of the Oberon community speaks
language other than American English and that which is trivially
represented in seven or eight bit ASCII. While changing the
representation assumption in Oberon-07 does increase complexity I feel
restrict the character presentation of a CHAR to eight bits puts us on
the side of “too simple” in the equation of “Simpler but not to
simple”.</p>
<p>I am concerned about the assumption of an INTEGER as 32 bits.
Increasingly I’ve seen single board computer implementations that are 64
bits. Today feels allot like when I started in computing where personal
computers were shifting from eight or sixteen bits to thirty two. I
suspect increasingly we will find that eight, sixteen and thirty two bit
computers are relegated to the realm of specialized computers. While
supporting these other widths will remain important I think shifting
assumptions to sixty four bit machines makes sense now. Is a 32 bit
machine “too simple” in our equation of “simpler but not too
simple”?</p>
<h2 id="oberon-as-operating-system">Oberon as Operating System</h2>
<p>The operating system I still find liberating in 2023 as when I first
was able to use it. The challenge in 2023 though is the three button
mouse. I think the supporting the historic mouse remains important but
that the viewers should also support navigation via the keyboard and
easily support touch systems that lack a mouse. Being backward
compatibly while adopting an enhance UI would make things more complex
bit if care is taken I think that it can be done while keep the equation
balanced as “simpler, but not too simple”.</p>
<h2 id="transforming-my-assumptions-in-2023">Transforming my assumptions
in 2023</h2>
<p>I think the Artemis Project should presume that the representation of
CHAR and INTEGER may change and probably should change. The portable
modules should support compiling Oberon-07 programs on non-Oberon 2014
Systems without change. I am skeptical that I can create a module system
that provides a base line with the historic Oberon implementations. I
think the Oakwood modules are just too limited. I think the assumption
is I need implementations for Project Oberon 2013 modules as the base
line perhaps enhanced with a few additional modules to supporting
networking, UTF-8, JSON, and XML. The goal I think is that using Artemis
on a non-Oberon System should facilitate bootstrapping an Oberon System
2023 should one come to exist.</p>
<h2 id="errata">Errata</h2>
<p>7:00 - 7:30; Oberon Language; A minimum SYSTEM module; It occurred to
me that while the SYSTEM module will need to address the specifics of
the hardware and host environment it could support a minimum set of
useful constants. What would be extremely helpful would be able to rely
on knowing the max size of an INTEGER, the size of CHAR (e.g. 8, 16 or
32 bits), default character encoding used by the compiler (e.g. ASCII,
UTF-8). Likewise it would be extremely helpful to know the the CPU type
(e.g. arm64, amd64, x86-32), Operating System/version and name/version
of the compiler. I think this would allow the modules that depend on
SYSTEM directly to become slightly more portable.</p>
