  # 7:30 AM, Oberon Language: A minimum SYSTEM module


  Post: Tuesday, October 18, 2022, 7:30 AM


  It occurred to me that while the SYSTEM module will need to address the
  specifics of the hardware and host environment it could support a minimum set
  of useful constants. What would be extremely helpful would be able to rely on
  knowing the max size of an INTEGER, the size of CHAR (e.g. 8, 16 or 32 bits),
  default character encoding used by the compiler (e.g. ASCII, UTF-8). Likewise
  it would be extremely helpful to know the the CPU type (e.g. arm64, amd64,
  x86-32), Operating System/version and name/version of the compiler.  I think
  this would allow the modules that depend on SYSTEM directly to become slightly
  more portable.
