<h1 id="compiling-pandoc-from-source">Compiling Pandoc from source</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2022-11-07</p>
<p>I started playing around with Pandoc’s <strong>pandoc-server</strong>
last Friday. I want to play with the latest version of Pandoc. When I
gave it a try this weekend I found that my Raspberry Pi 400’s SD card
was too small. This lead me to giving the build process a try on my
Ubuntu desktop. These are my notes about how I going about building from
scratch. I am not a Haskell programmer and don’t know the tool chain or
language. Take everything that follows with a good dose of salt but this
is what I did to get everything up and running. I am following the
compile from source instructions in Pandoc’s <a
href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/INSTALL.html">INSTALL.md</a></p>
<p>I’m running this first on an Intel Ubuntu box because I have the disk
space available there. If it works then I’ll try it directly on my
Raspberry Pi 400 with an upgrade SD card and running the 64bit version
of Raspberry Pi OS.</p>
<p>I did not have Haskell or Cabal installed when I started this
process.</p>
<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install <strong>stack</strong> (it will install GHC)</li>
<li>Clone the GitHub repo for <a
href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">Pandoc</a></li>
<li>Setup <strong>stack</strong> for Pandoc</li>
<li>Build and test with <strong>stack</strong></li>
<li>Install <strong>stack</strong> install</li>
<li>Make a symbolic link from <strong>pandoc</strong> to
<strong>pandoc-server</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt search &quot;haskell-stack&quot;
sudo apt install &quot;haskell-stack&quot;
stack upgrade
git clone git@github.com:jgm/pandoc src/github.com/jgm/pandoc
cd src/github.com/jgm/pandoc
stack setup 
stack build
stack test
stack install
ln $HOME/.local/bin/pandoc $HOME/.local/bin/pandoc-server</code></pre>
<p>This step takes a long time and on the Raspberry Pi it’ll take allot
longer.</p>
<p>The final installation of Pandoc was in my
<code>$HOME/.local/bin</code> directory. Assuming this is early in your
path this can allow you to experiment with a different version of Pandoc
from the one installed on your system.</p>
<p>I also wanted to try the latest of <strong>pandoc-server</strong>.
This was not automatically installed and is not mentioned in the
INSTALL.md file explicitly. But looking at the discussion of running
<strong>pandoc-server</strong> in CGI mode got me thinking. I then
checked the installation on my Ubuntu box for the packaged version of
pandoc-server and saw that is was a symbolic link. Adding a
<code>ln</code> command to my build instruction solved the problem.</p>
<p>I decided to try compiling Pandoc on my M1 mac. First I needed to get
<strong>stack</strong> installed. I use Mac Ports but it wasn’t in the
list of available packages. Fortunately the Haskell Stack website
provides a shell script for installation on Unixes. I wanted to install
<strong>stack</strong> in my home <code>bin</code> directory not
<code>/usr/bin/slack</code>. So after reviewing the downloaded install
script I found the <code>-d</code> option for changing where it installs
to. It indicated I need to additional work with
<strong>xcode</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ &gt; stack-install.sh
more stack-install.sh
sh stack-install.sh -d $HOME/bin</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>stack</strong> installation resulted in a message in this
form.</p>
<pre><code>Stack has been installed to: $HOME/bin/stack

NOTE: You may need to run &#39;xcode-select --install&#39; and/or
      &#39;open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg&#39;
      to set up the Xcode command-line tools, which Stack uses.

WARNING: &#39;$HOME/.local/bin&#39; is not on your PATH.
    Stack will place the binaries it builds in &#39;$HOME/.local/bin&#39; so
    for best results, please add it to the beginning of PATH in your profile.</code></pre>
<p>I already had xcode setup for compiling Go so those addition step was
not needed. I only needed to add <code>$HOME/.local/bin</code> to my
search path.</p>
<p>I then followed the steps I used on my Ubuntu Intel box.</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:jgm/pandoc src/github.com/jgm/pandoc
cd src/github.com/jgm/pandoc
stack setup
stack build
stack test
stack install
ln $HOME/.local/bin/pandoc $HOME/.local/bin/pandoc-server</code></pre>
<p>Now when I have a chance to update my Raspberry Pi 400 to a suitable
sized SD Card (or external drive) I’ll be ready to compile a current
version of Pandoc from source.</p>
<h2 id="additional-notes">Additional notes</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/">stack</a> is a
Haskell build tool. It setups up an Haskell environment per project. If
a project requires a specific version of the Haskell compiler it’ll be
installed and made accessible for the project. In this way it’s a bit
like having a specific environment for Python. The stack website
indicates that it targets cross platform development in Haskell which is
nice. Other features of stack remind me of Go “go” command in that it
can build things or Rust’s “cargo” command. Like <strong>cargo</strong>
it can update itself which is nice. That is what I did after installing
the Debian package version used by Ubuntu. Configuration of a “stack”
project uses YAML files. Stack uses <strong>cabal</strong>, Haskell’s
older build tool but subsumes <strong>cabal-install</strong> for setting
up <strong>cabal</strong> and <strong>ghc</strong>. It appears from my
reading that <strong>stack</strong> addresses some of the short falls
<strong>cabal</strong> originally had and specifically focusing on
reproducible compiles. This is important in sharing code as well as if
you want to integrate automated compilation and testing. It maintains a
project with “cabal files” so there is the ability to work with older
non-stack code if I read the documentation correctly. Both
<strong>cabal</strong> and <strong>stack</strong> seem to be evolving in
parallel taking different approaches but influencing one another. Both
systems use “cabal files” for describing projects and dependencies as of
2022. The short version of <a
href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/#why-stack">Why Stack</a>
can be found the <strong>stack</strong> website.</p>
<p><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a> is a central
repository of Haskell packages.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> is a curated subset
of Hackage packages. It appears to be the preferred place for
<strong>stack</strong> to pull from.</p>
