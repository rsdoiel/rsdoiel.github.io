<h1 id="feeds-formats-and-plain-text">Feeds, formats, and plain
text</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2022-11-01</p>
<p>There has been a proliferation of feed formats. My personal preferred
format is RSS 2.0. It’s stable and proven the test of type. Atom feeds
always felt a little like, “not invented here so we’re inventing it
again”, type of thing. The claim was they could support read/write but
so can RSS 2.0 specially with the namespace possibilities. The
innovative work <a href="https://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> has done
in the past and is doing today with <a
href="https://feedland.org">Feedland</a> is remarkably impressive.</p>
<p>In my experience the format of the feed is less critical than the how
to author the metadata. Over the last several years I’ve moved to static
hosting as my preferred way of hosting a website. My writing is
typically in Markdown or Fountain formats and frontmatter like used in
RMarkdown has proven very convenient. The “blogit” command that started
out from an idea in <a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/mkpage"
title="Make Page, a Pandoc preprocessor and tool set">mkpage</a> has
been implemented in <a href="https://github.com/rsdoiel/pttk"
title="Plain Text Toolkit">pttk</a>. So for me metadata authoring makes
sense in the front matter. That has the advantage that Pandoc can
leverage the information in its templates (that is what I use to render
HTML, man pages and the occasional PDF). It also is a food source for
data to include in a feed.</p>
<p>I’ve recently become aware of a really simple text format called <a
href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">twtxt</a>. This simple
format is meant for micro blogging but is also useful as a feed source
and format. Especially in terms of rendering content for Gopherspace
which I’ve re-engaged in recently. <a
href="https://yarn.social">Yarn.social</a> has built an entire ecosystem
around it. Very impressive. The format is so simple it can be done with
a pipe and the “echo” command in the shell. It looks promising in terms
for personal search ingest as well.</p>
<p>One of the formats that Dave Winer supports in Feedland and is used
in the micro blogging community he has connected with is <a
href="https://www.jsonfeed.org/">jsonfeeds</a>. It is lightweight and to
me feels allot like RSS 2.0 without the XML-isms that go along with it.
I’m playing with the idea that in pttk it’ll be the standard feed format
and that from it I can then render our traditional feed friends of RSS
2.0 and Atom.</p>
<p>I’ve looked at the ActivityPub from the Mastodon community but like
<a href="https://prologic.github.io/prologic/"
title="aka prologic">James Mill</a> I find it too complex. What is
needed is something simple, really simple. That’s why I’ve been looking
closely at Gopherspace again. The Gophermap can function as a bookmark
file, a “home page” a list of feeds. A little archaic but practical in
its simplicity. The only challenges I’ve run into has been figuring out
that expectations of the Gopher server software. Currently I’ve settled
on <a href="https://gophernicus.org">gophernicus</a> as that is was it
supported at <a href="https://sdf.org">sdf.org</a> where I have a gopher
“hole”.</p>
<p>As pttk grows and I explore where I can take simple text processing
I’m not targeting Gopherspace, twtxt and static websites. I’ve looked at
<a
href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi">Gemini</a>
but haven’t grokked the point yet. Their choice of yet another markup
for content seems problematic at best. For me gopher solves the problems
that would make me look at Gemini and I can use most any structured text
I want. The text just needs to be readable easily by humans. The
Gophermap provides can be enhanced menus much like “index.html” pages
have become (a trunk that branches and eventually leads to a leaf).</p>
<p><a href="http://home.opml.org/">OPML</a> remains a really nice
outline data format. It’s something I’d like to eventually integrate
with pttk. It can be easily represented as JSON. Just need to figure
what problem I am trying to solve by using it. Share a list of feeds is
the classic case but looking at twtxt as well as the <a
href="https://newsboat.org/">newsboat</a> URL list makes me think it is
more than I need. We’ll see. It is certainly reasonable to generate from
a simpler source. If I ever write a personal search engine (something
I’ve been thinking about to nearly a decade) it’d be a good way to share
curated indexes sources as well as sources to crawl. I just need to
think that through more.</p>
