<h1 id="turbo-oberon-the-dream">Turbo Oberon, the dream</h1>
<p>by R. S. Doiel, 2022-07-30</p>
<p>Sometimes I have odd dreams and that was true last night through
early this morning. The dream was set in the future. I was already
retired. It was a dream about “Turbo Oberon”.</p>
<p>“Turbo Oberon” was an Oberon language. The language compiler was
named “TO” in my dream. A module’s file extension was “.tom”, in honor
of Tom Lopez (Meatball Fulton) of ZBS. There were allot of ZBS
references in the dream.</p>
<p>“TO” was very much a language in the Oberon-07 tradition with minor
extensions when it came to bringing in modules. It allowed for a multi
path search for module names. You could also express a Module import as
a string allowing providing paths to the imported module.</p>
<p>Compilation was similar to Go. Cross compilation was available out of
the box by setting a few environment variables. I remember answering
questions about the language and its evolution. I remember mentioning in
the conversation about how I thought Go felling into the trap of
complexity like Rust or C/C++ before it. The turning point for Go was
generics. Complexity was the siren song to be resisted in “Turbo
Oberon”. Complexity is seductive to language designers and implementers.
I was only an implementer.</p>
<p>Evolution wise “TO” was built initially on the Go tool chain. As a
result it featured easily cross-compiled binaries and had a rich
standard set of Modules like Go but also included portable libraries for
implementing graphic user interfaces. “Turbo Oberon” evolved as a
conversation between Go and the clean simplicity of Oberon-07. Two
example applications “shipped” with the “TO” compiler. They were an
Oberon like Operating System (stand alone and hosted) and a Turbo Pascal
like IDE. The IDE was called “toe” for Turbo Oberon Editor. I don’t
remember the name of the OS implementation but it might have been
“toos”. I remember “TO” caused problems for search engines and catalog
systems.</p>
<p>I remember remarking in the dream that programming in “Turbo Oberon”
was a little like returning to my roots when I first learned to program
in Turbo Pascal. Except I could run my programs regardless of the
operating system or CPU architecture. ““TO” compiler supported cross
compilation for Unix, macOS, Windows on ARM, Intel, RISC-V. The targets
were inherited from Go implementation roots.</p>
<p>In my dream I remember forking Go 1.18 and first replacing the front
end of the compiler. I remember it was a challenge understanding the
implementation and generate a Go compatible AST. The mapping between
Oberon-07 and Go had its challenges. I remember first sticking to a
strict Oberon-07 compiler targeting POSIX before enhancing module
imports. I remember several failed attempts at getting module imports
“right”. I remember being on the fence about a map data type and going
with a Maps module. I don’t remember how introspection worked but saying
it was based on an ETH paper for Oberon 2. I remember the compiler, like
Go, eventually became self hosting. It supported a comments based DSL to
annotating RECORD types making encoding and decoding convenient, an
influence of Go and it’s tool chain.</p>
<p>I believe the “Turbo Oberon Editor” came first and that was followed
by the operating system implementation.</p>
<p>I remember talking about a book that influenced me called, “Operating
Systems through compilers” but don’t know who wrote it. I remember a
discussion about the debt owed to Prof. Wirth. I remember that the book
showed how once you really understood building the compile you could
then build the OS. There was a joke riffing on the old Lisp joke but
rephrased, “all applications evolve not to a Lisp but to an embedded
OS”.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant dream, in the dream I was older and already retired
but still writing “TO” code and having fun with computers. I remember a
closing video shot showing me typing away at what looked like the old
Turbo Pascal IDE. As Mojo Sam said in <strong>Somewhere Next Door to
Reality</strong>, “it was a sorta a retro future”.</p>
