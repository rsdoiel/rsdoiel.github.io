      <h1 id="turbo-oberon-the-dream">Turbo Oberon, the dream</h1>
      <p>by R. S. Doiel, 2022-07-30</p>
      <p>Sometimes I have odd dreams and that was true last night through early this morning. The dream was set in the future. I was already retired. It was a dream about &quot;Turbo Oberon&quot;.</p>
      <p>&quot;Turbo Oberon&quot; was an Oberon language. The language compiler was named &quot;TO&quot; in my dream. A module's file extension was &quot;.tom&quot;, in honor of Tom Lopez (Meatball Fulton) of ZBS. There were allot of ZBS references in the dream.</p>
      <p>&quot;TO&quot; was very much a language in the Oberon-07 tradition with minor extensions when it came to bringing in modules. It allowed for a multi path search for module names. You could also express a Module import as a string allowing providing paths to the imported module.</p>
      <p>Compilation was similar to Go. Cross compilation was available out of the box by setting a few environment variables. I remember answering questions about the language and its evolution. I remember mentioning in the conversation about how I thought Go felling into the trap of complexity like Rust or C/C++ before it. The turning point for Go was generics. Complexity was the siren song to be resisted in &quot;Turbo Oberon&quot;. Complexity is seductive to language designers and implementers. I was only an implementer.</p>
      <p>Evolution wise &quot;TO&quot; was built initially on the Go tool chain. As a result it featured easily cross-compiled binaries and had a rich standard set of Modules like Go but also included portable libraries for implementing graphic user interfaces. &quot;Turbo Oberon&quot; evolved as a conversation between Go and the clean simplicity of Oberon-07. Two example applications &quot;shipped&quot; with the &quot;TO&quot; compiler. They were an Oberon like Operating System (stand alone and hosted) and a Turbo Pascal like IDE. The IDE was called &quot;toe&quot; for Turbo Oberon Editor. I don't remember the name of the OS implementation but it might have been &quot;toos&quot;. I remember &quot;TO&quot; caused problems for search engines and catalog systems.</p>
      <p>I remember remarking in the dream that programming in &quot;Turbo Oberon&quot; was a little like returning to my roots when I first learned to program in Turbo Pascal. Except I could run my programs regardless of the operating system or CPU architecture. &quot;&quot;TO&quot; compiler supported cross compilation for Unix, macOS, Windows on ARM, Intel, RISC-V. The targets were inherited from Go implementation roots.</p>
      <p>In my dream I remember forking Go 1.18 and first replacing the front end of the compiler. I remember it was a challenge understanding the implementation and generate a Go compatible AST. The mapping between Oberon-07 and Go had its challenges. I remember first sticking to a strict Oberon-07 compiler targeting POSIX before enhancing module imports. I remember several failed attempts at getting module imports &quot;right&quot;. I remember being on the fence about a map data type and going with a Maps module.  I don't remember how introspection worked but saying it was based on an ETH paper for Oberon 2.  I remember the compiler, like Go, eventually became self hosting. It supported a comments based DSL to annotating RECORD types making encoding and decoding convenient, an influence of Go and it's tool chain.</p>
      <p>I believe the &quot;Turbo Oberon Editor&quot; came first and that was followed by the operating system implementation.</p>
      <p>I remember talking about a book that influenced me called, &quot;Operating Systems through compilers&quot; but don't know who wrote it. I remember a discussion about the debt owed to Prof. Wirth. I remember that the book showed how once you really understood building the compile you could then build the OS. There was a joke riffing on the old Lisp joke but rephrased, &quot;all applications evolve not to a Lisp but to an embedded OS&quot;.</p>
      <p>It was a pleasant dream, in the dream I was older and already retired but still writing &quot;TO&quot; code and having fun with computers. I remember a closing video shot showing me typing away at what looked like the old Turbo Pascal IDE. As Mojo Sam said in <strong>Somewhere Next Door to Reality</strong>, &quot;it was a sorta a retro future&quot;.</p>
