      <h1 id="rust-development-notes">Rust development notes</h1>
      <p>by R. S. Doiel, 2022-09-27</p>
      <p>I recently wanted to try <a href="https://github.com/jansc/ncgopher">ncgopher</a> which is a <a href="https://rust-lang.org">rust</a> based application. I was working on a an M1 Mac mini. I use <a href="https://www.macports.org">Mac Ports</a> for my userland applications and installed <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">cargo</a> to pickup the rust compiler and build tool</p>
      <pre><code class="language-shell">sudo port install cargo
      </code></pre>
      <p>All went well until I tried to build ncgopher and got an error as follows</p>
      <pre><code>cargo build --release
          Updating crates.io index
      error: Unable to update registry `crates-io`
      
      Caused by:
        failed to fetch `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
      
      Caused by:
        failed to authenticate when downloading repository: git@github.com:rust-lang/crates.io-index
      
        * attempted ssh-agent authentication, but no usernames succeeded: `git`
      
        if the git CLI succeeds then `net.git-fetch-with-cli` may help here
        https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#netgit-fetch-with-cli
      
      Caused by:
        no authentication available
      make: *** [build] Error 101
      </code></pre>
      <p>This seemed odd as I could run <code>git clone git@github.com:rust-lang/crates.io-index</code> successfully. Re-reading the error message a dim light went on. I checked the cargo docs and the value <code>net.git-fetch-with-cli</code> defaults to false. That meant that cargo was using its own embedded git. OK, that makes sense but how do I fix it. I had no problem using cargo installed via ports on an Intel iMac so what gives? When cargo got installed on the M1 there was now <code>.cargo/config.toml</code> file. If you create this and set the value of <code>git-fetch-with-cli</code> to true then the problem resolves itself.</p>
      <p>It was good that the error message provided a lead. It's also good that cargo has nice documentation. My experience though still left the taste of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=coik">COIK</a>. Not sure how to improve the situation. It's not really a cargo bug (unless config.taml should be always created), it's not a rust bug and I don't even think it is a ports packaging bug.  If I was a new developer just getting familiar with git I don't think I would have known how to solve my problem even with the documentation provided. Git is something that has always struggled with COIK. While I like it it does make things challenging.</p>
      <p>If I wind up playing with rust more then I'll add somemore notes here in the future.</p>
      <p>My <code>$HOME/.cargo/config.toml</code> file looks like to have cargo use the git cli instead of the built in rust library.</p>
      <pre><code>[net]
      git-fetch-with-cli = true
      </code></pre>
