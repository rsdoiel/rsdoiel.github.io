<h1 id="thinking-about-gopher">Thinking about Gopher</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2022-09-28</p>
<p>Last weekend I visited the <a href="gopher://gopher.floodgap.com"
title="Floodgap is a good starting point for Gopher">Gophersphere</a>
for the first time in a very long time. I’m happy to report it is still
alive an active. It remains fast, lower resource consuming. This
resulted in finding a Gopher protocol package in Go and adding light
weight Gopher server to <a
href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/pttk">pttk</a> my current vehicle for
experimenting with plain text writing tools.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking allot this past half week about where to explore
in Gopher. The biggest issue I ran into turned out to be easily solve.
Gopher protocol is traditionally served over port 70 but if you’re
running a *nix if you are just experimenting on localhost it is easier
to use port 7000 (analogous to port 80 becoming 8000 or 8080 in the
websphere). But some Gopher clients will only serve port 70. Two clients
work very well at 7000 and they are Lynx (the trusty old console web
browser) and one written in Rust called <a
href="https://github.com/jansc/ncgopher">ncgopher</a>. The latter I find
I use most of the time. It also supports Gemini sites though I am less
interested in Gemini at the movement. Gopher has a really nice sweet
spot of straight forward implementation for both client and server. It
would be a good exercise for moving from beginner to intermediate
programming classes as you would be introducing network programming, a
little parsing and the client server application models. It’s a really
good use case of looking back (Gopher is venerable in Internet age) and
looking forward (a radical simplification of distributing readable
material and related files).</p>
<h2 id="constraints-and-creativity">Constraints and creativity</h2>
<p>The simplicity and limitations of Gopher are inspiring. The
limitations are particularly important as they are good constraints that
help focus where to innovate. Gopher is a protocol ripe for software
innovation precisely because of it’s constraints.</p>
<p>Gophermaps is a good example. The Go package <a
href="https://git.mills.io/prologic/go-gopher">git.mills.io/prologic/go-gopjer</a>
supports easily building servers that have Gophermaps the way of
structuring the Gopher menus (aka selectors in Gopher parlance). A
Gophermaps is a plain text file where you have lines that start with a
Gopher supported document type (see <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)%20for%20details">Gopher
protocol</a> a label followed by a tab character, a relative path
followed by a tab character, a hostname followed by a tab character and
a port number. Very simple to parse. The problem is Gopher clients
expect all the fields for them to interpret them as a linked resource
(e.g. a text file, binary file, image, or another Gopher selector). When
I first encountered Gopher at USC so many years ago (pre-Mosaic,
pre-Netscape) Gophermaps selectors are trivial to setup and you could
build a service that supported ftp and Gopher in the same directory
structure. All the “development” of a gopher site was done directly on
the server in the directories where the files would live. Putting in all
values seemed natural. Today I don’t develop on a “production server” if
I can avoid it. My writing is done on a small pool of machines at home,
each with its own name. Explicitly writing a hostname and port with the
eye to publishing to a public site then becomes a game of running
<code>sed</code> to correct hostname and ports across the updated
Gophermap files.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gopher selectors form “links” to navigate through a Gopher site or
through the Gophersphere depending on what they point at</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without changing the protocol you could modify the go-gopher
package’s function for presenting a Gophermap where the hostname port is
assumed to the gopher server name and port if it was missing. Another
approach would be to translate a place holder value. This would
facilitate keeping your Gopher site under version control (e.g. Git and
GitHub) while allowing you to easily deploy a version of the site in a
public setting or in your development setting. The constraint of the
Gophermap definition as needed by the protocol doesn’t mean it forces a
cumbersome choice on your writing process.</p>
<p>Similarly the spaces versus tabs (invisible by default in many
editors) because a non-issue by adopting editors that support <a
href="https://editorconfig.org">editorconfig</a> or even making the
server slightly more complex in correctly identifying when to convert
spaces to tabs expanding them out to a Gopher selectors.</p>
<p>Client sites there are also many opportunities. <a
href="http://runtimeterror.com/tools/gopher/">Little Gopher Client</a>
pulls out the selectors its finds into a nice tree (like a bookmark
tree) in a left panel and puts the text in the main window. ncgopher
let’s you easily bookmark things and has a very clean, easy on the eyes
reading experience in the console. In principle you the client could
look at the retrieved selector and choose to display different file
types based on the file extension as well as the selector type
retrieved. This would let you include a richer experience in the
Gophersphere for light weight markup like Commonmark files while still
running nicely on Gopher protocol. Lots of room to innovate because the
protocol is simple, limited and stable after all these years.</p>
