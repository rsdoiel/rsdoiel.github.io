  # 4:30 PM, Golang: stngo


  Post: Friday, August 12, 2022, 4:30 PM


  A work slack exchange has perked my interest in using [simple timesheet
  notation](https://rsdoiel.github.io/stngo/docs/stn.html) for very short blog
  posts. This could be similar to Dave Winer title less posts on
  [scripting](http://scripting.com). How would this actually map? Should it be a
  tool in the [stngo](https://rsdoiel.githubio/stngo) project?
