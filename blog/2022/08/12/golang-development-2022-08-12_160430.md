# 4:30 PM, Golang: stngo

By R. S. Doiel, Friday, August 12, 2022 16:04 PDT

A work slack exchange has perked my interest in using [simple timesheet notation](https://rsdoiel.github.io/stngo/docs/stn.html) for very short blog posts. This could be similar to Dave Winer title less posts on [scripting](http://scripting.com). How would this actually map? Should it be a tool in the [stngo](https://rsdoiel.githubio/stngo) project?
