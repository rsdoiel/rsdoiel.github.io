  # 5:00 PM, Golang: pdtk,  stngo


  Post: Sunday, August 14, 2022, 5:00 PM


  Today I started an experiment. I cleaned up stngo a little today, still need
  to implement a general `Parse()` method that works on a `io.Reader`. After a
  few initial false starts I realized the "right" place for rendering simple
  timesheet notation as blog posts is in the the "blogit" action of
  [pdtk](https://rsdoiel.github.io/pttk). I think this form might be useful for
  both release notes in projects as well as a series aggregated from single
  paragraphs. The limitation of the single paragraph used in simple timesheet
  notation is intriguing. Proof of concept is working in v0.0.3 of pdtk. Still
  sorting out if I need a title and if so what it should be.
