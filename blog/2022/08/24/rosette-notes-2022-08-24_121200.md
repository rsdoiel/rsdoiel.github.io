  # 12:00 PM, SQL: Postgres


  Post: Wednesday, August 24, 2022, 12:00 PM


  I miss `SHOW TABLES` it's just muscle memory from MySQL, the SQL to show
  tables is `SELECT tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE tablename NOT LIKE
  'pg_%'

  `. I could write a SHOWTABLE in PL/pgSQL procedure implementing MySQL's "SHOW
  TABLES". Might be a good way to learn PL/pgSQL. I could then do one for MySQL
  and compare the PL/SQL language implementations.
