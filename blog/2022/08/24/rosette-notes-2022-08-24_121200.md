# 12:00 PM, SQL: Postgres

Post: Wednesday, August 24, 2022, 12:00 PM

I miss `SHOW TABLES` it's just muscle memory from MySQL, the SQL to show tables is `SELECT tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE tablename NOT LIKE 'pg_%'
`. I could write a SHOWTABLE in PL/pgSQL procedure implementing MySQL's "SHOW TABLES". Might be a good way to learn PL/pgSQL. I could then do one for MySQL and compare the PL/SQL language implementations.
