      <h1>Oberon Basic Types</h1>
      <p>By R. S. Doiel, 2020-04-18</p>
      <p>This is the third post in the <a href="../11/Mostly-Oberon.html">Mostly Oberon</a> series. Mostly Oberon documents my exploration of the Oberon Language, Oberon System and the various rabbit wholes I inevitably fell into.</p>
      <h2>Simple Types</h2>
      <p>Oberon is a small systems language. It provides a useful but
      limited umber of basic types. These can be be
      thought of as simple types mapping to specific memory locations
      and more complex types composed of multiple memory locations.</p>
      <p>NOTE: <strong>basic types</strong>, INTEGER, REAL, CHAR, ARRAY, RECORD and POINTER TO</p>
      <h3>INTEGER</h3>
      <p>Integers are easiest to be thought of as whole numbers. They may be
      positive numbers or negative numbers. Declaring an integer
      variable <code>i</code> it would look something like</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          VAR i : INTEGER;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>Setting <code>i</code>'s value to seven would look like</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          i := 7;
      
      </code></pre>
      <h3>REAL</h3>
      <p>Real holds real numbers. Real numbers contain a fractional
      component. We normally notate them with
      a decimal value e.g. &quot;0.01&quot;. Like integers they can also be
      positive or negative.</p>
      <p>Declaring a real number variable <code>a</code> would look like</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          VAR a : REAL;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>Setting the value of <code>a</code> to seven and one tenth (7.1) would
      look like</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          a := 7.1;
      
      </code></pre>
      <h3>CHAR</h3>
      <p>A CHAR is a single ASCII character. Oberon, unlike more recent
      languages like Go or Julia, predates the wide adoption of UTF-8.
      The character is represented in memory as one 8 bit byte.
      If you need to work with an extended character set then you need
      to either re-encode the values into ASCII. At this time[^now] there
      is no standard way of handling None ASCII character systems natively.
      If you need to work directly with an encoding such as UTF-8 you'll
      need to develop your own modules and procedures for handily their
      encoding, decoding and other operations.</p>
      <p>Declaring a CHAR variable <code>c</code> would look like</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          VAR c: CHAR;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>Setting the value of <code>c</code> to capital Z would look like</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          c := &quot;Z&quot;;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>Note: Oberon expects double quotes to notate a character.</p>
      <h3>More complex types</h3>
      <p>The simplest types would prove problematic when addressing
      more complex data representations if Oberon lacked two three built-in
      types - ARRAY, RECORD and POINTER TO.</p>
      <h3>ARRAY</h3>
      <p>An array is a sequence of memory locations which contain a common
      type.  In Oberon-07 all arrays have to have a known link. This is
      because the Oberon compiler is responsible for pre-allocating
      memory when the program starts to hold the array.  While this
      seems restrictive our next data type, RECORD, lets us move
      into more dynamic memory structures.  Pre-allocating the array
      size also has the advantage that we can re-use those locations
      easily in a type safe manner.</p>
      <p>Declaring a variable &quot;name&quot; as an array of twelve characters would
      look like and declaring a variable &quot;scores&quot; as an array of ten
      integers would look like</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          VAR 
            name : ARRAY 24 OF CHAR;
            scores : ARRAY 10 OF INTEGER;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>The length of the array immediately follows the keyword &quot;ARRAY&quot; and
      the &quot;OF CHAR&quot; or &quot;OF INTEGER&quot; phrases describes the types that can be
      contained in the array. In the &quot;OF CHAR&quot; the type is &quot;CHAR&quot; the
      &quot;OF INTEGER&quot; is the type &quot;INTEGER&quot;.</p>
      <p>Setting an array value can be done using an index. In this example
      the zero-th element (first element of the array) is set to the value
      102.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          scores[0] := 102;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>In the case of CHAR arrays the whole array can be set in a simple
      single assignment.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          name := &quot;Ada Lovelace&quot;;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>Two key points of arrays in Oberon are a known length and a single
      type of data associated with them. Arrays can have more than
      one dimension but the cells of the array most contain the same type.</p>
      <p>NOTE: <strong>type safety</strong>, Type safe means the compiler or run time verify that the data stored at that location conforms to the program defined, this is helpful in maintaining program correctness.</p>
      <h3>RECORD</h3>
      <p>The RECORD is Oberon's secret sauce. The record is used to
      create new types if data representations. It extend Oberon's basic
      types creating structured data representation. In this example we'll
      create a record that holds an game's name, a list of three player names
      and a list of three scores. We'll call this record type
      &quot;TopThreeScoreboard&quot;.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          TYPE
            TopThreeScoreboard = RECORD
              gameName : ARRAY 24 OF CHAR;
              playerNames : ARRAY 3, 24 OF CHAR;
              scores : ARRAY 3 OF INTEGER
            END;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>Now that we have describe a record of type &quot;TopThreeScoreboard&quot; we can
      declare it with our &quot;VAR&quot; statement.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          VAR
            scoreboard : TopThreeScoreboard;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>Setting the element values in a record uses a dot notation
      and if those elements are themselves. In this case we'll set
      the game name to &quot;Basketball&quot;, the three players are
      &quot;Ada Lovelace&quot;, &quot;Blaise Pascal&quot;, and &quot;John McCarthy&quot;, with
      the scores 102, 101, 100.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
         scoreboard.gameName := &quot;Basketball&quot;;
         scoreboard.playerNames[0] := &quot;Ada Lovelace&quot;;
         scoreboard.scores[0] := 102;
         scoreboard.playerNames[1] := &quot;Blaise Pascal&quot;;
         scoreboard.scores[0] := 101;
         scoreboard.playerNames[2] := &quot;John McCarthy&quot;;
         scoreboard.scores[0] := 100;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>Records are also used to create dynamic memory structures such as lists, trees and maps (see note on &quot;AD&quot;).  The dynamic nature of records is achieved with
      our next type &quot;POINTER TO&quot;.</p>
      <p>NOTE: <strong>AD</strong>, Prof. Wirth wrote an excellent text on <a href="https://inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/AD.pdf">Algorithms and Data structures</a> available in PDF format.</p>
      <h3>POINTER TO</h3>
      <p>Oberon is a type safe language. To keep things safe in a type
      safe language you need to place constraints around random
      memory access. Memory can be thought of a list of locations and
      we can go to those locations if we know their address. A pointer
      in most languages holds an address. Oberon has pointers but they
      must point at specific data types. So like array you have to indicate
      the type of the thing you are pointing at in a declaration.
      E.g. <code>VAR a : POINTER TO CHAR;</code> would declare a variable 'a'
      that points to a memory location that holds a CHAR. The more common
      case is we use &quot;POINTER TO&quot; in records to create dynamic data
      structures such as linked lists.</p>
      <p>Here's a simple data structure representing a dynamic list
      of characters. Let's call it a DString and we will implement
      it using a single link list. The list can be implemented by
      defining a RECORD type that holds a single character and a pointer
      to the next record. We can then also define a pointer to this type
      of record.  If there is no next character record
      we assume we're at the end of the string.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          TYPE
            DStringDesc = RECORD
              value : CHAR;
              next : POINTER TO DStringDesc
            END;
      
            DString : POINTER TO DStringDesc;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>RECORD types are permitted to use recursive definition so our
      &quot;next&quot; value is itself a type &quot;DStringDesc&quot;.  Declaring a
      DString variable is as easy as declaring our scoreboard type variable.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
        VAR
          VAR s : DString;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>Setting our DString is a little trickier. This is where
      Oberon's procedures come into play. We can pass our variable &quot;s&quot;
      of type DString to a procedure to build out our DString from an simple
      array of characters. Note &quot;s&quot; is declared as a &quot;VAR&quot; parameter
      in our procedure heading. Our <code>SetDString</code> will also need to handle
      creating new elements in our dynamic string. That is what Oberon's
      built-in <code>NEW()</code> procedure does. It allocates new memory for our
      list of records.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          PROCEDURE SetDString(VAR s : DString; buf : ARRAY OF CHAR);
              VAR i : INTEGER; cur, tmp : DString;
          BEGIN
            (* Handle the case where s is NIL *)
            IF s = NIL THEN
              NEW(s);
              s.value := 0X;
              s.next := NIL;
            END;
            cur := s;
            i := 0;
            (* check to see if we are at end of string or array *)
            WHILE (buf[i] # 0X) &amp; (i &lt; LEN(buf)) DO
              cur.value := buf[i];
              IF cur.next = NIL THEN
                NEW(tmp);
                tmp.value := 0X;
                tmp.next := NIL;
                cur.next := tmp;
              END;
              (* Advance our current pointer to the next element *)
              cur := cur.next;
              i := i + 1;
            END;
          END SetDString;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>We can move our string back into a fixed length array of char
      with a similar procedure.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-{.oberon}">
          PROCEDURE DStringToCharArray(s : DString; VAR buf : ARRAY OF CHAR);
            VAR cur : DString; i, l : INTEGER;
          BEGIN
            l := LEN(buf);
            i := 0;
            cur := s;
            WHILE (i &lt; l) &amp; (cur # NIL) DO
              buf[i] := cur.value; 
              cur := cur.next;
              i := i + 1;
            END;
            (* Zero out the rest of the string. *)
            WHILE (i &lt; l) DO
              buf[i] := 0X;
              i := i + 1;
            END;
          END DStringToCharArray;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>At this stage we have the basics of data organization. Modules
      allow us to group operations and data into cohesive focused units.
      Procedures allow us to define consistent ways of interacting with
      out data, and types singularly and collectively allow us to structure
      data in a way that is useful to solving problems.</p>
      <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
      <p>Here is a <a href="BasicTypeDemo.Mod">module demoing our basic type</a>. In it
      we can define procedures to demo our assignments, display their results
      all called from inside the module's initialization block.</p>

          MODULE BasicTypeDemo;

      <h2>Reading through the code</h2>
      <p>There are some nuances in Oberon syntax that can creep up on you.
      First while most statements end in a semi-colon there are noticeable
      exceptions. Look at the record statements in particular.  The last
      element of your record before the <code>END</code> does not have a semicolon.
      In that way it is a little like a <code>RETURN</code> value in a function
      like procedure.</p>
      <p>In creating our <code>DString</code> data structure the Oberon idiom is to first
      create a description record, <code>DStringDesc</code> then create a pointer to
      the descriptive type, i.e. <code>DString</code>. This is a very common
      idiom in building out complex data structures. A good place to learn
      about implementing algorithms and data structures in Oberon-07 is
      Prof. Wirth's 2004 edition of <a href="https://inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/AD.pdf">Algorithms and Data Structures</a> which
      is available from his personal website in PDF.</p>
