<h1 id="software-tools-getting-started">Software Tools, Getting
Started</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This post is the first in a series revisiting the programs described
in the 1981 book by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger’s called <a
href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern">Software Tools
in Pascal</a>. The book is available from the <a
href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> and physical copies are
still (2020) commonly available from used book sellers. The book was an
early text on creating portable command line programs.</p>
<p>In this series I present the K &amp; P (i.e. Software Tools in
Pascal) programs re-implemented in Oberon-07. I have testing my
implementations using Karl Landström’s <a
href="http://miasap.se/obnc/">OBNC</a> compiler and his implementation
of the Oakwood Guide’s modules for portable Oberon programs. Karl also
provides a few additional modules for working in a POSIX environment
(e.g. BSD, macOS, Linux, Windows 10 with Linux subsystem). I have also
tested these programs with Mike Spivey’s <a
href="http://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Oxford_Oberon-2_compiler">Oxford
Oberon Compiler</a> an aside from the differences file extensions that
both compilers use the source code works the same.</p>
<p>NOTE: OBNC compiler is the work of Karl Langström, it is portable
across many systems where the C tool chain is available.</p>
<p>NOTE: POSIX defines a standard of compatibility inspired by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX</a>, see <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX"
class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX</a></p>
<h2 id="getting-started.">Getting Started.</h2>
<p>Chapter one in K &amp; P is the first chapter that presents code. It
introduces some challenges and constraints creating portable Pascal
suitable for use across hardware architectures and operating systems. In
1981 this included mainframes, minicomputers as well as the recent
evolution of the microcomputer. The programs presented build up from
simple to increasingly complex as you move through the book. They
provide example documentation and discuss their implementation choices.
It is well worth reading the book for those discussions, while specific
to the era, mirror the problems program authors face today in spite of
the wide spread success of the POXIS model, the consolidation of CPU
types and improvements made in development tools in the intervening
decades.</p>
<p>Through out K &amp; P you’ll see the bones of many POSIX commands we
have today.</p>
<p>Programs from this chapter include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>copyprog</strong>, this is like “cat” in a POSIX system</li>
<li><strong>charcount</strong>, this is like the “wc” POSIX command
using the “-c” option</li>
<li><strong>linecount</strong>, this is like the “wc” POSIX command
using the “-l” option</li>
<li><strong>wordcount</strong>, this is like the “wc” POSIX command
using the “-w” option</li>
<li><strong>detab</strong>, converts tabs to spaces using tab stops
every four characters in a line</li>
</ol>
<p>All programs in this chapter rely solely on standard input and
output. Today’s reader will notice an absence to common concepts in
today’s command line programs. First is the lack of interaction with
command line parameters, the second is no example take advantage of
environment variables. These operating system features were not always
available across operating systems of the early 1980s. Finally I’d like
to point out a really nice feature included in the book. It is often
left out as a topic in programming books. K &amp; P provide example
documentation. It’s structure like an early UNIX man page. It very clear
and short. This is something I wish all programming texts at least
mentioned. Documentation is important to the program author because it
clarifies scope of the problem being tackled and to the program user so
they understand what they are using.</p>

href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/7/mode/1up">1.1.
File Copying</a></h3>
<p>Here’s how K &amp; P describe “copyprog.pas” (referred to as “copy”
in the documentation).</p>
<pre><code>
PROGRAM

    copy    copy input to output

USAGE

    copy

FUNCTION

    copy copies its input to its output unchanged. It is useful for copying
    from a terminal to a file, from file to file, or even from terminal to
    terminal. It may be used for displaying the contents of a file, without
    interpretation or formatting, by copying from the file to terminal.

EXAMPLE

    To echo lines type at your terminal.

    copy
    hello there, are you listening?
    **hello there, are you listening?**
    yes, I am.
    **yes, I am.**
    &lt;ENDFILE&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The source code for “copyprog.pas” is shown on <a
href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/9/mode/1up">page
9</a> of K &amp; P. First the authors introduce the
<strong>copy</strong> procedure then a complete the section introducing
it in context of the complete Pascal program. After this first example K
&amp; P leave implementation of the full program up to the reader.</p>
<p>The body of the Pascal program invokes a procedure called <a
href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/8/mode/1up">copy</a>
which reads from standard input character by character and writes to
standard output character by character without modification. Two
supporting procedures are introduced, “getc” and “putc”. These are shown
in the complete program listing on page 9. They are repeatedly used
through out the book. One of the really good aspects of this simple
program is relying on the idea of standard input and output. This makes
“copyprog.pas” a simple filter and template for writing many of the
programs that follow. K &amp; P provide a good explanation for this
simple approach. Also note K &amp; P’s rational for working character by
character versus line by line.</p>
<p>My Oberon-07 version takes a similar approach. The module looks
remarkably similar to the Pascal but is shorter because reading and
writing characters are provided for by Oberon’s standard modules “In”
and “Out”. I have chosen to use a “REPEAT/UNTIL” loop over the “WHILE”
loop used by K &amp; P is the attempt to read from standard input needs
to happen at least once. Note in my “REPEAT/UNTIL” loop’s terminating
condition. The value of <code>In.Done</code> is true on successful read
and false otherwise (e.g. you hit an end of the file). That means our
loop must terminate on <code>In.Done # TRUE</code> rather than
<code>In.Done = TRUE</code>. This appears counter intuitive unless you
keep in mind our loop stops when we having nothing more to read, rather
than when we can continue to read. It <code>In.Done</code> means the
read was successful and does not mean “I’m done and can exit now”.
Likewise before writing out the character we read, it is good practice
to check the <code>In.Done</code> value. If <code>In.Done</code> is
TRUE, I know can safely display the character using
<code>Out.Char(c);</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
MODULE CopyProg;
IMPORT In, Out;

PROCEDURE copy;
VAR
  c : CHAR;
BEGIN
  REPEAT
    In.Char(c);
    IF In.Done THEN
        Out.Char(c);
    END;
  UNTIL In.Done # TRUE;
END copy;

BEGIN
  copy();
END CopyProg.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>
<p>This program only works with standard input and output. A more
generalized version would work with named files.</p>
<h3 id="counting-characters"><a
href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/13/mode/1up">1.2
Counting Characters</a></h3>
<pre><code>
PROGRAM

  charcount count characters in input

USAGE

  charcount

FUNCTION

  charcount counts the characters in its input and writes the total
  as a single line of text to the output. Since each line of text is
  internally delimited by a NEWLINE character, the total count is the
  number of lines plus the number of characters within each line.

EXAMPLE

  charcount
  A single line of input.
  &lt;ENDFILE&gt;
  24
</code></pre>
<p><a
href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/13/mode/1up">On
page 13</a> K &amp; P introduces their second program,
<strong>charcount</strong>. It is based on a single procedure that reads
from standard input and counts up the number of characters encountered
then writes the total number found to standard out followed by a
newline. In the text only the procedure is shown, it is assumed you’ll
write the outer wrapper of the program yourself as was done with the
<strong>copyprog</strong> program. My Oberon-07 version is very similar
to the Pascal. Like in the our first “CopyProg” we will make use of the
“In” and “Out” modules. Since we will need to write an INTEGER value
we’ll also use “Out.Int()” procedure which is very similar to K &amp;
P’s “putdec()”. Aside from the counting this is very simple like our
first program.</p>
<pre><code>
MODULE CharCount;
IMPORT In, Out;

PROCEDURE CharCount;
VAR
  nc : INTEGER;
  c : CHAR;
BEGIN
  nc := 0;

  REPEAT
    In.Char(c);
    IF In.Done THEN
      nc := nc + 1;
    END;
  UNTIL In.Done # TRUE;
  Out.Int(nc, 1);
  Out.Ln();
END CharCount;

BEGIN
  CharCount();
END CharCount.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="limitations-1">Limitations</h4>
<p>The primary limitation in counting characters is most readers are
interested in visible character count. In our implementation even
non-printed characters are counted. Like our first program this only
works on standard input and output. Ideally this should be written so it
works on any file including standard input and output. If the reader
implements that it could become part of a package on statistical
analysis of plain text files.</p>
<h3 id="counting-lines"><a
href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/14/mode/1up">1.3
Counting Lines</a></h3>
<pre><code>
PROGRAM

  linecount count lines in input

USAGE

  linecount

FUNCTION

  linecount counts the lines in its input and write the total as a
  line of text to the output.

EXAMPLE

  linecount
  A single line of input.
  &lt;ENDFILE&gt;
  1
</code></pre>
<p><strong>linecount</strong>, from <a
href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/15/mode/1up">page
15</a> is very similar to <strong>charcount</strong> except adding a
conditional count in the loop for processing the file. In our Oberon-07
implementation we’ll check if the <code>In.Char(c)</code> call was
successful but we’ll add a second condition to see if the character read
was a NEWLINE. If it was I increment our counter variable.</p>
<pre><code>
MODULE LineCount;
IMPORT In, Out;

PROCEDURE LineCount;
CONST
  NEWLINE = 10;

VAR
  nl : INTEGER;
  c : CHAR;
BEGIN
  nl := 0;
  REPEAT
    In.Char(c);
    IF In.Done &amp; (ORD(c) = NEWLINE) THEN
      nl := nl + 1;
    END;
  UNTIL In.Done # TRUE;
  Out.Int(nl, 1);
  Out.Ln();
END LineCount;

BEGIN
  LineCount();
END LineCount.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="limitations-2">Limitations</h4>
<p>This program assumes that NEWLINE is ASCII value 10. Line delimiters
vary between operating systems. If your OS used carriage returns without
a NEWLINE then this program would not count lines correctly. The reader
could extend the checking to support carriage returns, new lines, and
carriage return with new lines and cover most versions of line
endings.</p>
<h3 id="counting-words"><a
href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/14/mode/1up">1.4
Counting Words</a></h3>
<pre><code>
PROGRAM

  wordcount count words in input

USAGE

  wordcount

FUNCTION

  wordcount counts the words in its input and write the total as a
  line of text to the output. A &quot;word&quot; is a maximal sequence of characters
  not containing a blank or tab or newline.

EXAMPLE

  wordcount
  A single line of input.
  &lt;ENDFILE&gt;
  5

BUGS

  The definition of &quot;word&quot; is simplistic.
</code></pre>
<p><a
href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/17/mode/1up">Page
17</a> brings us to the <strong>wordcount</strong> program. Counting
words can be very nuanced but here K &amp; P have chosen a simple
definition which most of the time is “good enough” for languages like
English. A word is defined simply as an run of characters separated by a
space, tab or newline characters. In practice most documents will work
with this minimal definition. It also makes the code straight forward.
This is a good example of taking the simple road if you can. It keeps
this program short and sweet.</p>
<p>If you follow along in the K &amp; P book note their rational and
choices in arriving at there solutions. There solutions will often
balance readability and clarity over machine efficiency. While the code
has progressed from “if then” to “if then else if” logical sequence, the
solution’s modeled remains clear. This means the person reading the
source code can easily verify if the approach chosen was too simple to
meet their needs or it was “good enough”.</p>
<p>My Oberon-07 implementation is again very simple. Like in previous
programs I still have an outer check to see if the read worked
(i.e. “In.Done = TRUE”), otherwise the conditional logic is the same as
the Pascal implementation.</p>
<pre><code>
MODULE WordCount;
IMPORT In, Out;

PROCEDURE WordCount;
CONST
  NEWLINE = 10;
  BLANK = 32;
  TAB = 9;

VAR
  nw : INTEGER;
  c : CHAR;
  inword : BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  nw := 0;
  inword := FALSE;
  REPEAT
    In.Char(c);
    IF In.Done THEN
      IF ((ORD(c) = BLANK) OR (ORD(c) = NEWLINE) OR (ORD(c) = TAB)) THEN
        inword := FALSE;
      ELSIF (inword = FALSE) THEN
        inword := TRUE;
        nw := nw + 1;
      END;
    END;
  UNTIL In.Done # TRUE;
  Out.Int(nw, 1);
  Out.Ln();
END WordCount;

BEGIN
  WordCount();
END WordCount.

Removing Tabs</a></h2>
<pre><code>
PROGRAM

  detab convert tabs into blanks

USAGE

  detab

FUNCTION

  detab copies its input to its output, expanding the horizontal
  tabs to blanks along the way, so that the output is visually
  the same as the input, but contains no tab characters. Tab stops
  are assumed to be set every four columns (i.e. 1, 5, 9, ...), so
  each tab character is replaced by from one to four blanks.

EXAMPLE

  Usaing &quot;-&gt;&quot; as a visible tab:

  detab
  -&gt;col 1-&gt;2-&gt;34-&gt;rest
      col 1   2   34  rest

BUGS

  detab is naive about backspaces, vertical motions, and
  non-printing characters.
</code></pre>
<p>The source code for “detab” can be found on <a
href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/24/mode/1up">page
24</a> in the last section of chapter 1. <strong>detab</strong> removes
tabs and replaces them with spaces. Rather than a simple “tab” replaced
with four spaces <strong>detab</strong> preserves a concept found on
typewriters called “tab stops”. In 1981 typewrites were still widely
used though word processing software would become common. Supporting the
“tab stop” model means the program works with what office workers would
expect from older tools like the typewriter or even the computer’s
teletype machine. I think this shows an important aspect of writing
programs. Write the program for people, support existing common concepts
they will likely know.</p>
<p>K &amp; P implementation includes separate source files for setting
tab stops and checking a tab stop. The Pascal K &amp; P wrote for didn’t
support separate source files or program modules. Recent Pascal versions
did support the concept of modularization (e.g. UCSD Pascal). Since and
significant goal of K &amp; P was portability they needed to come up
with a solution that worked on the “standard” Pascal compilers available
on minicomputers and mainframes and not write their solution to a
specific Pascal system like UCSD Pascal (see Appendix, “IMPLEMENTATION
PRIMITIVES <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/315/mode/1up">page
315</a>). Modularization facilitates code reuse and like information
hiding is an import software technique. Unfortunately the preprocessor
approach doesn’t support information hiding.</p>
<p>To facilitate code reuse the K &amp; P book includes a preprocessor
as part of the Pascal development tools (see <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/71/mode/1up">page
71</a> for implementation). The preprocessor written in Pascal was based
on the early versions of the “C” preprocessor they had available in the
early UNIX systems. Not terribly Pascal like but it worked and allowed
the two files to be shared between this program and one in the next
chapter.</p>
<p>Oberon-07 of course benefits from all of Wirth’s language
improvements that came after Pascal. Oberon-07 supports modules and as
such there is no need for a preprocessor. Because of Oberon-07’s module
support I’ve implemented the Oberon version using two files rather than
three. My main program file is “Detab.Mod”, the supporting library
module is “Tabs.Mod”. “Tabs” is where I define our tab stop data
structure as well as the procedures that operating on that data
structure.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the first part, “Detab.Mod”. This is the module that
forms the program and it features an module level “BEGIN/END” block. In
that block I call “Detab();” which implements the program’s
functionality. I import “In”, “Out” as before but I also import “Tabs”
which I will show next. Like my previous examples I validate the read
was successful before proceeding with the logic presented in the
original Pascal and deciding what to write to standard output.</p>
<pre><code>
MODULE Detab;
  IMPORT In, Out, Tabs;

CONST
  NEWLINE = 10;
  TAB = 9;
  BLANK = 32;

PROCEDURE Detab;
VAR
  c : CHAR;
  col : INTEGER;
  tabstops : Tabs.TabType;
BEGIN
  Tabs.SetTabs(tabstops); (* set initial tab stops *)
  col := 1;
  REPEAT
    In.Char(c);
    IF In.Done THEN
      IF (ORD(c) = TAB) THEN
        REPEAT
          Out.Char(CHR(BLANK));
          col := col + 1;
        UNTIL Tabs.TabPos(col, tabstops);
      ELSIF (ORD(c) = NEWLINE) THEN
        Out.Char(c);
        col := 1;
      ELSE
        Out.Char(c);
        col := col + 1;
      END;
    END;
  UNTIL In.Done # TRUE;
END Detab;

BEGIN
  Detab();
END Detab.
</code></pre>
<p>Our second module is “Tabs.Mod”. It provides the supporting
procedures and definition of the our “TabType” data structure. For us
this is the first time we write a module which “exports” procedures and
type definitions. If you are new to Oberon, expected constants,
variables and procedures names have a trailing “*“. Otherwise the Oberon
compiler will assume a local use only. This is a very powerful
information hiding capability and what allows you to evolve a modules’
internal implementation independently of the programs that rely on
it.</p>
<pre><code>
MODULE Tabs;

CONST
  MAXLINE = 1000; (* or whatever *)

TYPE
  TabType* = ARRAY MAXLINE OF BOOLEAN;

(* TabPos -- return TRUE if col is a tab stop *)
PROCEDURE TabPos*(col : INTEGER; VAR tabstops : TabType) : BOOLEAN;
  VAR res : BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  res := FALSE; (* Initialize our internal default return value *)
  IF (col &gt;= MAXLINE) THEN
    res := TRUE;
  ELSE
    res := tabstops[col];
  END;
  RETURN res
END TabPos;

(* SetTabs -- set initial tab stops *)
PROCEDURE SetTabs*(VAR tabstops: TabType);
CONST
  TABSPACE = 4; (* 4 spaces per tab *)
VAR
  i : INTEGER;
BEGIN
  (* NOTE: Arrays in Oberon start at zero, we want to
     stop at the last cell *)
  FOR i := 0 TO (MAXLINE - 1) DO
    tabstops[i] := ((i MOD TABSPACE) = 0);
  END;
END SetTabs;

END Tabs.
</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: This module is used by “Detab.Mod” and “Entab.Mod” and provides
for common type definitions and code reuse. We exported
<code>TabType</code>, <code>TabPos</code> and <code>SetTabs</code>.
Everything else is private to this module.</p>
<h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2>
<p>This post briefly highlighted ports of the programs presented in
Chapter 1 of “Software Tools in Pascal”. Below are links to my source
files of the my implementations inspired by the K &amp; P book. Included
in each Oberon module source after the module definition is transcribed
text of the program documentation as well as transcribed text of the K
&amp; P Pascal implementations. Each file should compiler without
modification using the OBNC compiler. By default the OBNC compiler will
use the module’s name as the name of the executable version. I I have
used mixed case module names, if you prefer lower case executable names
use the “-o” option with the OBNC compiler.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>If you happen to be using The <a
