      <h1 id="software-tools-filters">Software Tools, Filters</h1>
      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>This post is the second in a series revisiting the programs<br />
      described in the 1981 book by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J.<br />
      Plauger's called <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern">Software Tools in Pascal</a>. The book is available from the<br />
      <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> and physical copies<br />
      are still (2020) commonly available from used book sellers.<br />
      The book was an late 20th century text on creating portable<br />
      command line programs using ISO standard Pascal of the era.</p>
      <p>In this chapter K &amp; P focuses on developing the idea of filters.<br />
      Filters are programs which typically process standard input, do<br />
      some sort of transformation or calculation and write to standard<br />
      output.  They are intended to work either standalone or in a pipeline<br />
      to solve more complex problems. I like to think of filters as<br />
      software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego">LEGO</a>.<br />
      Filter programs can be &quot;snapped&quot; together creating simple shapes<br />
      data shapes or combined to for complex compositions.</p>
      <p>The programs from this chapter include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>entab</strong>, respecting tabstops, convert strings of spaces to tabs</li>
      <li><strong>overstrike</strong>, this is probably not useful anymore, it would allow &quot;overstriking&quot; characters on devices that supported it. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overstrike">wikipedia</a>, &quot;In typography, overstrike is a method of printing characters that are missing from the printer's character set. The character was created by placing one character on another one — for example, overstriking &quot;L&quot; with &quot;-&quot; resulted in printing a &quot;Ł&quot; (L with stroke) character.&quot;</li>
      <li><strong>compress</strong>, an early UNIX style compress for plain text files</li>
      <li><strong>expand</strong>, an early UNIX style expand for plain text files, previously run through with <strong>compress</strong></li>
      <li><strong>echo</strong>, write echo's command line parameters to standard output, introduces working with command line parameters</li>
      <li><strong>translit</strong>, transliterate characters using a simple from/to substitution with a simple notation to describe character sequences and negation. My implementation diverges from K &amp; P</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="implementing-in-oberon-07">Implementing in Oberon-07</h2>
      <p>With the exception of <strong>echo</strong> (used to introduce command line parameter processing) each program increases in complexity.  The last program <strong>translit</strong>is the most complex in this chapter.  It introducing what we a &quot;domain specific language&quot; or &quot;DSL&quot;.  A DSL is a notation allowing us to describe something implicitly rather than explicitly. All the programs except <strong>translit</strong> follow closely the original Pascal translated to Oberon-07.  <strong>translit</strong> book implementation is very much a result of the constraints of Pascal of the early 1980s as well as the minimalist assumption that could be made about the host operating system. I will focus on revising that program in particular bring the code up to current practice as well as offering insights I've learned.</p>
      <p>The program <strong>translit</strong> introduces what is called a &quot;Domain Specific Language&quot;.Domain specific languages or DSL for short are often simple notations to describe how to solve vary narrow problems.  If you've used any of the popular spreadsheet programs where you've entered a formula to compute something you've used a domain specific language.  If you've ever search for text in a document using a regular expression you've used a domain specific language.  By focusing a notation on a small problem space you can often come up with simple ways of expressing or composing programmatic solutions to get a job done.</p>
      <p>In <strong>translit</strong> the notation let's us describe what we want to translate. At the simplest level the <strong>translit</strong> program takes a character and replaces it with another character. What make increases <strong>translit</strong> utility is that it can take a set of characters and replace it with another.  If you want to change all lower cases letters and replace them with uppercase letters. This &quot;from set&quot; and &quot;to set&quot; are easy to describe as two ranges, &quot;a&quot; to &quot;z&quot; and &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Z&quot;.  Our domain notation allows us to express this as &quot;a-z&quot; and &quot;A-Z&quot;.  K &amp; P include several of features in there notation including characters to exclude from a translation as well as an &quot;escape notation&quot; for describing characters like new lines, tabs, or the characters that describe a range and exclusion (i.e. dash and caret).</p>

      <p><a href="https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/31/mode/1up">Page 31</a></p>
      <p>Implementing <strong>entab</strong> in Oberon-07 is straight forward.<br />
      Like my <a href="Detab.Mod">Detab</a> implementation I am using<br />
      a second modules called <a href="Tabs.Mod">Tabs</a>. This removes<br />
      the need for the <code>#include</code> macros used in the K &amp; P version.<br />
      I have used the same loop structure as K &amp; P this time.<br />
      There is a difference in my <code>WHILE</code> loop. I separate the<br />
      character read from the <code>WHILE</code> conditional test.  Combining the<br />
      two is common in &quot;C&quot; and is consistent with the programming style<br />
      other books by Kernighan.  In Oberon-07 doesn't make sense at all.<br />
      Oberon's <code>In.Char()</code> is not a function returning as in the Pascal<br />
      primitives implemented for the K &amp; P book or indeed like in the &quot;C&quot;<br />
      language. In Oberon's &quot;In&quot; module the status of a read operation is<br />
      exposed by <code>In.Done</code>. I've chosen to put the next call to<br />
      <code>In.Char()</code> at the bottom of my <code>WHILE</code> loop because it is clear<br />
      that it is the last think done before ether iterating again or<br />
      exiting the loop. Other than that the Oberon version looks much<br />
      like K &amp; P's Pascal.</p>

      PROGRAM
      
        entab	convert runs of blanks into tabs
      
      USAGE
      
        entab
      
      FUNCTION
      
        entab copies its input to its output, replacing strings of
        blanks by tabs so the output is visually the same as the
        input, but contains fewer characters. Tab stops are assumed
        to be set every four columns (i.e. 1, 5, 9, ...), so that
        each sequence of one to four blanks ending on a tab stop
        is replaced by a tab character
      
      EXAMPLE
      
        Using -&gt; as visible tab:
      
          entab
            col  1   2   34  rest
          -&gt;col-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;34-&gt;rest
      
      BUGS
      
        entab is naive about backspaces, virtical motions, and
        non-printing characters. entab will convert  a single blank
        to a tab if it occurs at a tab stop. The entab is not an
        exact inverse of detab.

      <h1 id="22-overstrikes">2.2 Overstrikes</h1>
      <p><a href="https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/34/mode/1up">Page 34</a></p>
      <p>Overstrike isn't a tool that is useful today but I've included it<br />
      simply to be follow along the flow of the K &amp; P book. It very much<br />
      reflects an error where teletype like devices where still common and<br />
      printers printed much like typewriters did. On a 20th century<br />
      manual type writer you could underline a word or letter by backing<br />
      up the carriage then typing the underscore character. Striking out<br />
      a word was accomplished by a similar technique. The mid to late<br />
      20th century computers device retained this mechanism though by<br />
      1980's it was beginning to disappear along with manual typewriters.<br />
      This program relies on the the nature of ASCII character set and<br />
      reflects some of the non-print character's functionality. I<br />
      found it did not work on today's terminal emulators reliably. Your<br />
      mileage may very nor do I have a vintage printer to test it on.</p>
      <p>Our module follows K &amp; P design almost verbatim. The differences<br />
      are those suggested by differences between Pascal and Oberon-07.<br />
      Like in previous examples we don't need to use an ENDFILE constant<br />
      as we can simply check the value of <code>In.Done</code> to determine<br />
      if the last read was successful. This simplifies some of<br />
      the <code>IF/ELSE</code> logic and the termination of the <code>REPEAT/UNTIL</code><br />
      loop.  It makes the <code>WHILE/DO</code> loop a little more verbose.</p>
      <p>One thing I would like to point out in the original Pascal of the<br />
      book is a problem often referred to as the &quot;dangling else&quot; problem.<br />
      While this is usually discussed in the context of compiler<br />
      implementation I feel like it is a bigger issue for the person<br />
      reading the source code. It is particularly problematic when you<br />
      have complex &quot;IF/ELSE&quot; sequences that are nested.  This is not<br />
      limited to the 1980's era Pascal. You see it in other languages<br />
      like C.  It is a convenience for the person typing the source code<br />
      but a problem for those who maintain it. We see this ambiguity in<br />
      the Pascal procedure <strong>overstrike</strong> inside the repeat loop<br />
      on <a href="https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/35/mode/1up">page 35</a>.<br />
      It is made worse by the fact that K &amp; P have taken advantage of<br />
      omitting the semi-colons where optional. If you type in this<br />
      procedure and remove the indication if quickly becomes ambiguous<br />
      about where on &quot;IF/ELSE&quot; begins and the next ends. In Oberon-07 it<br />
      is clear when you have a dangling &quot;IF&quot; statement. This vintage<br />
      Pascal, not so much.</p>
      <p>K &amp; P do mention the dangling &quot;ELSE&quot; problem later in the text.<br />
      Their recommend practice was include the explicit final &quot;ELSE&quot;<br />
      at a comment to avoid confusion. But you can see how easy an<br />
      omitting the comment is in the <strong>overstrike</strong> program.</p>
      <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
      <p>This is documented &quot;BUG&quot; section describes the limitations<br />
      well, &quot;<strong>overstrike</strong> is naive about vertical motions and non-<br />
      printing characters. It produces one over struck line for each<br />
      sequence of backspaces&quot;. But in addition to that most printing<br />
      devices these days either have their own drivers or expect to work<br />
      with a standard like Postscript. This limited the usefulness of<br />
      this program today though controlling character movement in a<br />
      &quot;vt100&quot; emulation using old fashion ASCII control codes is<br />
      still interesting if only for historical reasons.</p>

        It is assumed that the output is to be printed on a device

        control; a blank carriage control causes normal space before
        print, while a plus sign '+' suppresses space before print
        and hence causes the remainder of the line to overstrike
        the previous line.

      <p><a href="https://archive.org/stream/softwaretoolsinp00kern?ref=ol#page/37/mode/1up">Page 37</a></p>
      <p>In 20th century computing everything is expensive, memory,<br />
      persistent storage computational ability in CPU.  If you were<br />
      primarily working with text you still worried about running out of<br />
      space in your storage medium. You see it in the units<br />
      of measurement used in that era such as bytes, kilobytes, hertz and<br />
      kilohertz. To day we talk about megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes and<br />
      petabytes. Plain text files are a tiny size compared to must<br />
      digital objects today but in the late 20th century<br />
      their size in storage was still a concern.  One way to solve this<br />
      problem was to encode your plain text to use less storage space.<br />
      Early attempts at file compression took advantage of repetition to<br />
      save space. Many text documents have repeated characters<br />
      whether spaces or punctuation or other formatting. This is what<br />
      inspired the K &amp; P implementation of <strong>compress</strong> and <strong>expand</strong>.<br />
      Today we'd use other approaches to save space whether we were<br />
      storing text or a digital photograph.</p>

      <p>Our procedures map closely to the original Pascal with a few<br />
      significant differences.  As previously I've chosen a<br />
      <code>REPEAT ... UNTIL</code> loop structure because we are always attempting<br />
      to read at least once. The <code>IF THEN ELSIF ELSE</code> logic is a little<br />
      different. In the K &amp; P version they combine retrieving<br />
      a character and testing its value.  This is a style common in<br />
      languages like C. As previous mentioned I split the read of the<br />
      character from the test.  Aside from the choices imposed by the<br />
      &quot;In&quot; module I also feel that retrieving the value, then testing is<br />
      a simpler statement to read. There is little need to worry about a<br />
      side effect when you separate the action from the test. It does<br />
      change the structure of the inner and outer <code>IF</code> statements.</p>

      USAGE
      
          expand
      
      FUNCTION
      
          expand copies its input, which has presumably been encoded by
          compress, to its output, replacing code sequences -nc by the
          repeated characters they stand for so that the text output
          exactly matches that which was originally encoded. The
          occurrence of the warning character - in the input means that
          which was originally encoded. The occurrence of the warning
          character - in the input means that the next character is a
          repetition count; 'A' calls for one instance of the following
          character, 'B' calls for two, and so on up to 'Z'.

      <p><strong>translit</strong> is the most complicated program so far in the book.<br />
      Most of the translation process from Pascal to Oberon-07 has<br />
      remained similar to the previous examples.</p>
      <p>My implementation of <strong>translit</strong> diverges from the K &amp; P<br />
      implementation at several points. Much of this is a result of<br />
      Oberon evolution beyond Pascal. First Oberon counts arrays from<br />
      zero instead of one so I have opted to use -1 as a value to<br />
      indicate the index of a character in a string was not found.<br />
      Equally I have simplified the logic in <code>xindex()</code> to make it clear<br />
      how I am handling the index lookup described in <code>index()</code> of the<br />
      Pascal implementation. K &amp; P implemented <code>makeset()</code> and <code>dodash()</code>.<br />
      <code>dodash()</code> particularly looked troublesome. If you came across the<br />
      function name <code>dodash()</code> without seeing the code comments<br />
      &quot;doing a dash&quot; seems a little obscure.  I have chosen to name<br />
      that process &quot;Expand Sequence&quot; for clarity. I have simplified the<br />
      task of making sets of characters for translation into three cases<br />
      by splitting the test conditions from the actions. First check to<br />
      see if we have an escape sequence and if so handle it. Second check<br />
      to see if we have an expansion sequence and if so handle it else<br />
      append the char found to the end of the set being assembled. This<br />
      resulted in <code>dodash()</code> being replaced by <code>IsSequence()</code> and<br />
      <code>ExpandSequence()</code>.  Likewise <code>esc()</code> was replaced with <code>IsEscape()</code><br />
      and <code>ExpandEscape()</code>. I renamed <code>addchar()</code> to <code>AppendChar()</code><br />
      in the &quot;Chars&quot; module as that seemed more specific and clearer.</p>
      <p>I choose to advance the value used when expanding a set description<br />
      in the loop inside of my <code>MakeSet()</code>. I minimized the side effects<br />
      of the expand functions to the target destination.  It is clearer<br />
      while in the <code>MakeSet()</code> loop to see the relationship of the test<br />
      and transformation and how to advance through the string. This also<br />
      allowed me to use fewer parameters to procedures which tends to<br />
      make things more readable as well as simpler.</p>
      <p>I have included an additional procedure not included in the K &amp; P<br />
      Pascal of this program. <code>Error()</code> displays a string and halts.<br />
      K &amp; P provide this as part of their Pascal environment. I have<br />
      chosen to embed it here because it is short and trivial.</p>
      <p>Translit suggested the &quot;Chars&quot; module because of the repetition in<br />
      previous programs. In K &amp; P the approach to code reuse is to create<br />
      a separate source file and to included via a pre-processor. In<br />
      Oberon we have the module concept.</p>
      <p>My <a href="Chars.Mod">Chars</a> module provides a useful set of test<br />
      procedures like <code>IsAlpha(c)</code>, <code>IsUpper(c)</code>, <code>IsLower()</code> in addition<br />
      to the <code>CharInRange()</code> and <code>IsAlphaNum()</code>.  It also includes<br />
      <code>AppendChar()</code> which can be used to append a single character value<br />
      to an end of an array of char.</p>

      PROGRAM
      
          translit    transliterate characters
      
      USAGE
      
          translit    [^]src [dest]
      
      FUNCTION
      
          translit maps its input, on a character by character basis, and
          writes the translated version to its output.In the simplest case,
          each character is the argument src is translated to the
          corresponding character is the argument dest; all other characters
          are copies as is. Both the src and dest may contain substrings of
          the form c1 - c2 as shorthand for all the characters in the range
          c1..c2 and c2 must both be digits, or both be letter of the same
          case. If dest is absent, all characters represented by src are
          deleted. Otherwise, if dest is shorter than src, all characters
          is src that would map to or beyond the last character in
          dest are mapped to the last character in dest; moreover adjacent
          instances of such characters in the input are represented in the
          output by a single instance of the last character in dest. The
      
              translit 0-9 9
      
          converts each string of digits to the single digit 9.
          Finally, if src is precedded by ^, then all but the characters
          represented by src are taken as the source string; i.e., they are
          all deleted if dest is absent, or they are all collapsed if the
          last character in dest is present.
      
      EXAMPLE
      
          To convert upper case to lower:
      
              translit A-Z a-z
      
          To discard punctualtion and isolate words by spaces on each line:
      
              translit ^a-zA-Z@n &quot; &quot;
              This is a simple-minded test, i.e., a test of translit.
              This is a simple minded test i e a test of translit

      <h1 id="in-closing">In closing</h1>
      <p>In this chapter we interact with some of the most common features<br />
      of command line programs available on POSIX systems. K &amp; P have given<br />
      us a solid foundation on which to build more complex and ambitious<br />
      programs. In the following chapters the read will find an<br />
      accelerated level of complexity bit also programs that are<br />
      significantly more powerful.</p>
      <p>Oberon language evolved with the Oberon System which had a very<br />
      different rich text user interface when compared with POSIX.<br />
      Fortunately Karl's OBNC comes with a set of modules that make<br />
      Oberon-07 friendly for building programs for POSIX operating systems.<br />
      I've taken advantage of his <code>extArgs</code> module much in the way<br />
      that K &amp; P relied on a set of primitive tools to provide a common<br />
      programming environment. K &amp; P's version of<br />
      <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwaretoolsinp00kern/page/315/mode/1up">implementation of primitives</a><br />
      listed in their appendix. Karl's OBNC extensions modules are<br />
      described on <a href="https://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/ext/">website</a>.<br />
      Other Oberon compilers provide similar modules though implementation<br />
      specific. A good example is Spivey's <a href="https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Oxford_Oberon-2_compiler">Oxford Oberon-2 Compiler</a>.<br />
      K &amp; P chose to target multiple Pascal implementations, I have the<br />
      luxury of targeting one Oberon-07 implementation. That said if you<br />
      added a pre-processor like K &amp; P did you could also take their approach<br />
      to allow you Oberon-07 code to work across many Oberon compiler<br />
      implementations. I leave that as an exercise for the reader.</p>
      <p>I've chosen to revise some of the code presented in K &amp; P's book. I<br />
      believe the K &amp; P implementations still contains wisdom in their<br />
      implementations. They had different constraints and thus made<br />
      different choices in implementation. Understand the trade offs and<br />
      challenges to writing portable code capable of running in very<br />
      divergent set of early 1980's operating systems remains useful today.</p>
