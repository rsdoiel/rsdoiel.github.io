      <h1 id="words-matter">Words Matter</h1>
      <p>By R. S. Doiel, 2020-07-08</p>
      <p>UPDATE (2020-08-15, RSD): When I added a post today I was VERY pleased to<br />
      to see that GitHub now allows me to publish my blog via the &quot;main&quot; branch.<br />
      It's nice to see the change in the words we use.</p>
      <p><strong>Why does software development use the vocabulary of slavery and<br />
      Jim Crow to describe our creations?</strong> What we call things matters.<br />
      This is especially true of the words we use day to day without thinking.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-shell">    git pull origin master
      </code></pre>
      <p>&quot;Naming things is a hard problem in computer science.&quot; That is<br />
      a phrase I remember from my student days. We name variables,<br />
      programs and algorithms. We name architectures. Naming is a choice.<br />
      The names convey meaning and intent. Names and terms are a human<br />
      communication. They matter.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-shell">    git push origin master
      </code></pre>
      <h2 id="names-can-change">Names can change</h2>
      <p>I remember the first time I encountered the terminology &quot;master/slave&quot;<br />
      describing network and database architecture. I remember cringing at<br />
      the terms. I accepted the terminology because I was a student and<br />
      naively assumed that those terms were chosen innocently and did not<br />
      mean what they did. I was wrong.</p>
      <p>Example MySQL command:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-sql">    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST=host1,
          MASTER_PORT=3002 FOR CHANNEL 'channel2';
      </code></pre>
      <p>When I did not challenge the use of those terms in computer science<br />
      I became complicit in the status quo of systemic racism. I am not happy<br />
      about that. Not then and not now.  We need inclusive language<br />
      in engineering. We need real diversity to find solutions to<br />
      today's challenges.  In software engineering we very much control what<br />
      we call things. Software is an explicit form of written human<br />
      communication. Words count. Words directly impact culture and our<br />
      community.</p>
      <p>Example MySQL commands:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-sql">    START SLAVE;
          RESET SLAVE;
          STOP SLAVE;
      </code></pre>
      <p>As a direct benefactor of white male privilege I find the<br />
      terminology of &quot;master/slave&quot; offensive.  I am certain those<br />
      words caused injury to those who did not benefit from the same white<br />
      male privilege.  Using &quot;master/slave&quot; terminology to describe database,<br />
      replication, network architectures or as used with version control<br />
      systems like Git is like polishing statues that glorify slavery.<br />
      It endorses inhumanity in a subtle and casual way.</p>
      <p>We have a choice about how we communicate and what we communicate<br />
      to convey meaning.  Let's use better words. It is time to change<br />
      some.</p>
      <h2 id="practice-change">Practice Change</h2>
      <p><strong>To change our community's vocabulary we need to thoughtfully choose terms</strong>.<br />
      My friends and colleagues introduced me to using the term &quot;main&quot; as<br />
      a better descriptive word than &quot;master&quot; in Git repositories. When<br />
      I started making the branch name changes in my Git repositories I ran<br />
      across a problem at GitHub.</p>
      <h2 id="note-the-problem">Note the problem</h2>
      <p>Recently GitHub made it possible to easily change the default branch.<br />
      For a number of years you could change the published documentation<br />
      branch from &quot;gh-pages&quot; to something you prefer.<br />
      What you can't do is change the name of the branch used to publish<br />
      personal and group websites.  <strong>GitHub explicitly states that the<br />
      publication branch must be named &quot;master&quot;.</strong> I tested this and<br />
      confirmed the documentation is accurate as of today (2020-07-08, morning).</p>
      <p>With the recent improvements in GitHub to allow default branches to<br />
      be named better it seems odd that you still have to publish<br />
      personal and group pages to &quot;master&quot; in order to publish a website. It<br />
      never made sense to me that person and group pages didn't use the default<br />
      of &quot;gh-pages&quot; in the first place.</p>
      <h2 id="taking-action">Taking action</h2>
      <p>Morning (2020-07-08): I submitted a ticket to GitHub asking to have<br />
      the option of using another word besides &quot;master&quot; for the publication<br />
      branch in publishing my personal GitHub pages (i.e. this blog).<br />
      Unfortunately the ticket doesn't have a public URL. I don't know how many<br />
      other people have submitted similar requests. If only a few people<br />
      have requested this recently it will not be changed. Such is the nature<br />
      of systemic problems.</p>
      <p>Please help improve the words and names we use in software.<br />
      I believe it can make a difference in creating a more inclusive and<br />
      equitable community and profession. Raise the issue when it comes to<br />
      your attention. Silence becomes acceptance with systemic problems.</p>
      <h2 id="a-reply">A reply</h2>
      <p>Evening (2020-07-08): I got a reply today from Steve G of customer<br />
      support. Not sure if the reply is a bot or human.  It was a nice polite<br />
      reply (I wrote a nice polite ticket).  Steve mentioned that CEO Nat<br />
      Friedman had addressed this on twitter and to follow the GitHub blog<br />
      news.  Steve said dropping master was a priority for GitHub but there<br />
      is no time line for implementation.</p>
      <p>I am not sure how you can develop software with a priority in mind and<br />
      not have a sense of time it takes to implement it.  I mentioned that in my<br />
      response to Steve G.</p>
      <p>After some Duck Duck searching I found a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955">BBC article</a> dated June 15th, 2020 where Nat made the<br />
      announcement about Microsoft's GitHub making the change away from &quot;master&quot;.<br />
      Next week is July 15th. It will be interesting to see how much of an unscheduled priority this change is.</p>
      <p>I am skeptical.  If Steve G had indicated that they are actively working<br />
      the problem and provided a general time range I would be more inclined to<br />
      give Nat, GitHub and Microsoft the benefit of the doubt.  Given the rest<br />
      of the content I read on Nat's twitter feed I don't think this is a priority<br />
      beyond press, publicity and stock price.</p>
      <h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here?</h2>
      <p>Just as many sites have adopted more gender neutral terms in documentation<br />
      practice we should encourage better descriptive terms for our algorithms,<br />
      and architectures. If you run into terms perpetuating exclusion please<br />
      speak up.  Most of the web runs on web servers and databases.  Like GitHub<br />
      those software projects frequently use the terminology of &quot;master/slave&quot;.<br />
      It is especially prevalent in documentation about replication. Blindly<br />
      perpetuating the &quot;master/slave&quot; terminology to describe distributed<br />
      software and architectures is like polishing a statue to the old<br />
      Confederacy. It can and should be change. We can communicate better<br />
      without perpetuating the vocabulary of Jim Crow, segregation, slavery<br />
      and oppression.</p>
