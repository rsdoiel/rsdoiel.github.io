      <h1>Words Matter</h1>
      <p>By R. S. Doiel, 2020-07-08</p>
      <p>UPDATE (2020-08-15, RSD): When I added a post today I was VERY pleased to
      to see that GitHub now allows me to publish my blog via the &quot;main&quot; branch.
      It's nice to see the change in the words we use.</p>
      <p><strong>Why does software development use the vocabulary of slavery and
      Jim Crow to describe our creations?</strong> What we call things matters.
      This is especially true of the words we use day to day without thinking.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-shell">    git pull origin master
      </code></pre>
      <p>&quot;Naming things is a hard problem in computer science.&quot; That is
      a phrase I remember from my student days. We name variables,
      programs and algorithms. We name architectures. Naming is a choice.
      The names convey meaning and intent. Names and terms are a human
      communication. They matter.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-shell">    git push origin master
      </code></pre>
      <h2>Names can change</h2>
      <p>I remember the first time I encountered the terminology &quot;master/slave&quot;
      describing network and database architecture. I remember cringing at
      the terms. I accepted the terminology because I was a student and
      naively assumed that those terms were chosen innocently and did not
      mean what they did. I was wrong.</p>
      <p>Example MySQL command:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-sql">    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST=host1,
          MASTER_PORT=3002 FOR CHANNEL 'channel2';
      </code></pre>
      <p>When I did not challenge the use of those terms in computer science
      I became complicit in the status quo of systemic racism. I am not happy
      about that. Not then and not now.  We need inclusive language
      in engineering. We need real diversity to find solutions to
      today's challenges.  In software engineering we very much control what
      we call things. Software is an explicit form of written human
      communication. Words count. Words directly impact culture and our
      community.</p>
      <p>Example MySQL commands:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-sql">    START SLAVE;
          RESET SLAVE;
          STOP SLAVE;
      </code></pre>
      <p>As a direct benefactor of white male privilege I find the
      terminology of &quot;master/slave&quot; offensive.  I am certain those
      words caused injury to those who did not benefit from the same white
      male privilege.  Using &quot;master/slave&quot; terminology to describe database,
      replication, network architectures or as used with version control
      systems like Git is like polishing statues that glorify slavery.
      It endorses inhumanity in a subtle and casual way.</p>
      <p>We have a choice about how we communicate and what we communicate
      to convey meaning.  Let's use better words. It is time to change
      some.</p>
      <h2>Practice Change</h2>
      <p><strong>To change our community's vocabulary we need to thoughtfully choose terms</strong>.
      My friends and colleagues introduced me to using the term &quot;main&quot; as
      a better descriptive word than &quot;master&quot; in Git repositories. When
      I started making the branch name changes in my Git repositories I ran
      across a problem at GitHub.</p>
      <h2>Note the problem</h2>
      <p>Recently GitHub made it possible to easily change the default branch.
      For a number of years you could change the published documentation
      branch from &quot;gh-pages&quot; to something you prefer.
      What you can't do is change the name of the branch used to publish
      personal and group websites.  <strong>GitHub explicitly states that the
      publication branch must be named &quot;master&quot;.</strong> I tested this and
      confirmed the documentation is accurate as of today (2020-07-08, morning).</p>
      <p>With the recent improvements in GitHub to allow default branches to
      be named better it seems odd that you still have to publish
      personal and group pages to &quot;master&quot; in order to publish a website. It
      never made sense to me that person and group pages didn't use the default
      of &quot;gh-pages&quot; in the first place.</p>
      <h2>Taking action</h2>
      <p>Morning (2020-07-08): I submitted a ticket to GitHub asking to have
      the option of using another word besides &quot;master&quot; for the publication
      branch in publishing my personal GitHub pages (i.e. this blog).
      Unfortunately the ticket doesn't have a public URL. I don't know how many
      other people have submitted similar requests. If only a few people
      have requested this recently it will not be changed. Such is the nature
      of systemic problems.</p>
      <p>Please help improve the words and names we use in software.
      I believe it can make a difference in creating a more inclusive and
      equitable community and profession. Raise the issue when it comes to
      your attention. Silence becomes acceptance with systemic problems.</p>
      <h2>A reply</h2>
      <p>Evening (2020-07-08): I got a reply today from Steve G of customer
      support. Not sure if the reply is a bot or human.  It was a nice polite
      reply (I wrote a nice polite ticket).  Steve mentioned that CEO Nat
      Friedman had addressed this on twitter and to follow the GitHub blog
      news.  Steve said dropping master was a priority for GitHub but there
      is no time line for implementation.</p>
      <p>I am not sure how you can develop software with a priority in mind and
      not have a sense of time it takes to implement it.  I mentioned that in my
      response to Steve G.</p>
      <p>After some Duck Duck searching I found a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955">BBC article</a> dated June 15th, 2020 where Nat made the
      announcement about Microsoft's GitHub making the change away from &quot;master&quot;.
      Next week is July 15th. It will be interesting to see how much of an unscheduled priority this change is.</p>
      <p>I am skeptical.  If Steve G had indicated that they are actively working
      the problem and provided a general time range I would be more inclined to
      give Nat, GitHub and Microsoft the benefit of the doubt.  Given the rest
      of the content I read on Nat's twitter feed I don't think this is a priority
      beyond press, publicity and stock price.</p>
      <h2>Where to go from here?</h2>
      <p>Just as many sites have adopted more gender neutral terms in documentation
      practice we should encourage better descriptive terms for our algorithms,
      and architectures. If you run into terms perpetuating exclusion please
      speak up.  Most of the web runs on web servers and databases.  Like GitHub
      those software projects frequently use the terminology of &quot;master/slave&quot;.
      It is especially prevalent in documentation about replication. Blindly
      perpetuating the &quot;master/slave&quot; terminology to describe distributed
      software and architectures is like polishing a statue to the old
      Confederacy. It can and should be change. We can communicate better
      without perpetuating the vocabulary of Jim Crow, segregation, slavery
      and oppression.</p>
