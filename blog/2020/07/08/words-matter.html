<h1 id="words-matter">Words Matter</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2020-07-08</p>
<p>UPDATE (2020-08-15, RSD): When I added a post today I was VERY
pleased to to see that GitHub now allows me to publish my blog via the
“main” branch. It’s nice to see the change in the words we use.</p>
<p><strong>Why does software development use the vocabulary of slavery
and Jim Crow to describe our creations?</strong> What we call things
matters. This is especially true of the words we use day to day without
thinking.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    git pull origin master</code></pre>
<p>“Naming things is a hard problem in computer science.” That is a
phrase I remember from my student days. We name variables, programs and
algorithms. We name architectures. Naming is a choice. The names convey
meaning and intent. Names and terms are a human communication. They
matter.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    git push origin master</code></pre>
<h2 id="names-can-change">Names can change</h2>
<p>I remember the first time I encountered the terminology
“master/slave” describing network and database architecture. I remember
cringing at the terms. I accepted the terminology because I was a
student and naively assumed that those terms were chosen innocently and
did not mean what they did. I was wrong.</p>
<p>Example MySQL command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode sql"><code class="sourceCode sql"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">CHANGE</span> <span class="kw">MASTER</span> <span class="kw">TO</span> MASTER_HOST<span class="op">=</span>host1,</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    MASTER_PORT<span class="op">=</span><span class="dv">3002</span> <span class="cf">FOR</span> CHANNEL <span class="st">&#39;channel2&#39;</span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When I did not challenge the use of those terms in computer science I
became complicit in the status quo of systemic racism. I am not happy
about that. Not then and not now. We need inclusive language in
engineering. We need real diversity to find solutions to today’s
challenges. In software engineering we very much control what we call
things. Software is an explicit form of written human communication.
Words count. Words directly impact culture and our community.</p>
<p>Example MySQL commands:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode sql"><code class="sourceCode sql"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">START</span> SLAVE;</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">RESET</span> SLAVE;</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">STOP</span> SLAVE;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As a direct benefactor of white male privilege I find the terminology
of “master/slave” offensive. I am certain those words caused injury to
those who did not benefit from the same white male privilege. Using
“master/slave” terminology to describe database, replication, network
architectures or as used with version control systems like Git is like
polishing statues that glorify slavery. It endorses inhumanity in a
subtle and casual way.</p>
<p>We have a choice about how we communicate and what we communicate to
convey meaning. Let’s use better words. It is time to change some.</p>
<h2 id="practice-change">Practice Change</h2>
<p><strong>To change our community’s vocabulary we need to thoughtfully
choose terms</strong>. My friends and colleagues introduced me to using
the term “main” as a better descriptive word than “master” in Git
repositories. When I started making the branch name changes in my Git
repositories I ran across a problem at GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="note-the-problem">Note the problem</h2>
<p>Recently GitHub made it possible to easily change the default branch.
For a number of years you could change the published documentation
branch from “gh-pages” to something you prefer. What you can’t do is
change the name of the branch used to publish personal and group
websites. <strong>GitHub explicitly states that the publication branch
must be named “master”.</strong> I tested this and confirmed the
documentation is accurate as of today (2020-07-08, morning).</p>
<p>With the recent improvements in GitHub to allow default branches to
be named better it seems odd that you still have to publish personal and
group pages to “master” in order to publish a website. It never made
sense to me that person and group pages didn’t use the default of
“gh-pages” in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="taking-action">Taking action</h2>
<p>Morning (2020-07-08): I submitted a ticket to GitHub asking to have
the option of using another word besides “master” for the publication
branch in publishing my personal GitHub pages (i.e. this blog).
Unfortunately the ticket doesn’t have a public URL. I don’t know how
many other people have submitted similar requests. If only a few people
have requested this recently it will not be changed. Such is the nature
of systemic problems.</p>
<p>Please help improve the words and names we use in software. I believe
it can make a difference in creating a more inclusive and equitable
community and profession. Raise the issue when it comes to your
attention. Silence becomes acceptance with systemic problems.</p>
<h2 id="a-reply">A reply</h2>
<p>Evening (2020-07-08): I got a reply today from Steve G of customer
support. Not sure if the reply is a bot or human. It was a nice polite
reply (I wrote a nice polite ticket). Steve mentioned that CEO Nat
Friedman had addressed this on twitter and to follow the GitHub blog
news. Steve said dropping master was a priority for GitHub but there is
no time line for implementation.</p>
<p>I am not sure how you can develop software with a priority in mind
and not have a sense of time it takes to implement it. I mentioned that
in my response to Steve G.</p>
<p>After some Duck Duck searching I found a <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955">BBC article</a>
dated June 15th, 2020 where Nat made the announcement about Microsoft’s
GitHub making the change away from “master”. Next week is July 15th. It
will be interesting to see how much of an unscheduled priority this
change is.</p>
<p>I am skeptical. If Steve G had indicated that they are actively
working the problem and provided a general time range I would be more
inclined to give Nat, GitHub and Microsoft the benefit of the doubt.
Given the rest of the content I read on Nat’s twitter feed I don’t think
this is a priority beyond press, publicity and stock price.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here?</h2>
<p>Just as many sites have adopted more gender neutral terms in
documentation practice we should encourage better descriptive terms for
our algorithms, and architectures. If you run into terms perpetuating
exclusion please speak up. Most of the web runs on web servers and
databases. Like GitHub those software projects frequently use the
terminology of “master/slave”. It is especially prevalent in
documentation about replication. Blindly perpetuating the “master/slave”
terminology to describe distributed software and architectures is like
polishing a statue to the old Confederacy. It can and should be change.
We can communicate better without perpetuating the vocabulary of Jim
Crow, segregation, slavery and oppression.</p>
