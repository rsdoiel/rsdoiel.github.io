      <h2 id="working-with-standard-input">Working with standard input</h2>
      <p>By R. S. Doiel, 2020-08-15 (updated: 2020-09-05)</p>
      <p>Karl Landström's <a href="https://miasap.se/obnc/">OBNC</a>, Oberon-07 compiler,<br />
      comes with an Oberon-2 inspired set of modules<br />
      described in the Oakwood Guidelines as well as<br />
      several very useful additions making Oberon-07 suitable for<br />
      writing programs in a POSIX environment.  We're going to<br />
      explore three of the Oakwood modules and two of Karl's own additions<br />
      in this post as we create a program called <a href="SlowCat.Mod">SlowCat</a>.<br />
      I am using the term &quot;portable&quot; to mean the code can be compiled<br />
      using OBNC on macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi OS and Windows 10<br />
      (i.e. wherever OBNC is available). The Oakwood Guideline modules<br />
      focus on portability between an Oberon System and other systems.<br />
      I'll leave that discussion along with<br />
      <a href="http://www.fim.uni-linz.ac.at/pow/pow.htm">POW!</a><br />
      to the end of this post.</p>
      <h3 id="slowcat">SlowCat</h3>
      <p>Recently while I was reviewing logs at work using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)">cat</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a><br />
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_(command)">more</a> it<br />
      struck me that it would have been nice if <strong>cat</strong><br />
      or <strong>more</strong> came with a time delay so you could use them like a<br />
      teleprompter. This would let you casually watch the file scroll<br />
      by while still being able to read the lines. The program we'll build<br />
      in this post is &quot;SlowCat&quot; which accepts a command line parameter<br />
      indicating the delay in seconds between display each line read from<br />
      standard input.</p>
      <h2 id="working-with-standard-input-and-output">Working with Standard Input and Output</h2>
      <p>The Oakwood guides for Oberon-2 describe two modules<br />
      particularly useful for working with standard input and output.<br />
      They are appropriately called <code>In</code> and <code>Out</code>. On many Oberon Systems<br />
      these have been implemented such that your code could run under Unix<br />
      or Oberon System with a simple re-compile.  We've used <code>Out</code> in our<br />
      first program of this series, &quot;Hello World&quot;. It provides a means to<br />
      write Oberon system base types to standard out.  We've used <code>In</code><br />
      a few times too. But <code>In</code> is worth diving into a bit more.</p>
      <h3 id="in">In</h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/In.def.html">In</a> module provides<br />
      a mirror of inputs to those of <a href="http://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/Out.def.html">Out</a>. In Karl's implementation we are interested in one procedure<br />
      and module status variable.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><code>In.Line(VAR line: ARRAY OF CHAR)</code> : Read a sequence of characters from standard input from the current position in the file to the end of line.</li>
      <li><code>In.Done</code> : Is a status Boolean variable, if the last call to an procedure in <code>In</code> was successful then it is set TRUE, otherwise FALSE (e.g. we're at the end of a file)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We use Karl's <code>In.Line()</code> extension to the standard <code>In</code> implementation<br />
      before and will do so again as it simplifies our code and keeps things<br />
      easily readable.</p>
      <p>There is one nuance with <code>In.Done</code> that is easy to get tripped up on.<br />
      <code>In.Done</code> indicates if the last operation was successful.<br />
      So if you're using <code>In.Line()</code> then <code>In.Done</code><br />
      should be true if reading the line was successful. If you hit the end of<br />
      the file then <code>In.Done</code> should be false.  When you write your loop<br />
      this can be counter intuitive.  Here is a example of testing <code>In.Done</code><br />
      with a repeat until loop.</p>
      <pre><code>
          REPEAT
            In.Line(text);
            IF In.Done THEN
              Out.String(text);Out.Ln();
            END;
          UNTIL In.Done = FALSE;
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>So when you read this it is easy to think of <code>In.Done</code> as you're<br />
      done reading from standard input but actually we need to check for <code>FALSE</code>.<br />
      The value of <code>In.Done</code> was indicating the success of reading our line.<br />
      An unsuccessful line read, meaning we're at the end of the file, sets<br />
      <code>In.Done</code> to false!</p>
      <h3 id="out">Out</h3>
      <p>As mention <code>Out</code> provides our output functions. We'll be using<br />
      two procedure from <code>Out</code>, namely <code>Out.String()</code> and <code>Out.Ln()</code>.<br />
      We've seen both before.</p>
      <h3 id="input">Input</h3>
      <p>&quot;SlowCat&quot; needs to calculate how often to write a line of<br />
      text to standard output with the <code>Out</code> module.  To do that<br />
      I need access to the system's current time.  There isn't an<br />
      Oakwood module for time. There is a module called<br />
      <code>Input</code> which provides a &quot;Time&quot; procedure. As a result<br />
      I need to import <code>Input</code> as well as <code>In</code> even though<br />
      I am using <code>In</code> to manage reading the file I am processing<br />
      with &quot;SlowCat&quot;.</p>
      <p>A note about Karl's implementation.  <code>Input</code> is an Oakwood<br />
      module that provides access to three system resources --<br />
      mouse, keyboard and system time.  Karl<br />
      provides two versions <code>Input</code> and <code>Input0</code>, the first is<br />
      intended to be used with the <code>XYPlane</code> module for graphical<br />
      applications the second for POSIX shell based application.<br />
      In the case of &quot;SlowCat&quot; I've stuck with <code>Input</code> as I am<br />
      only accessing time I've stuck with <code>Input</code> to make my source<br />
      code more portable if you're using another Oberon compiler.</p>
      <h2 id="working-with-karls-extensions">Working with Karl's extensions</h2>
      <p>This is the part of my code which is not portable<br />
      between compiler implementations and with Oberon Systems.<br />
      Karl provides a number of extension module wrapping various<br />
      POSIX calls.  We are going to use two,<br />
      <a href="http://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/ext/extArgs.def.html">extArgs</a><br />
      which provides access to command line arguments and<br />
      <a href="http://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/ext/extConvert.def.html">extConvert</a><br />
      which provides a means of converting strings to integers.<br />
      If you are using another Oberon compiler you'll need to<br />
      find their equivalents and change my code example. I<br />
      use <code>extArgs</code> to access the command line parameters<br />
      included in my POSIX shell invocation and I've used<br />
      <code>extConvert</code> to convert the string presentation of the<br />
      delay to an integer value for my delay.</p>
      <h2 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h2>
      <p>To create &quot;SlowCat&quot; we need four procedures and one<br />
      global variable.</p>
      <p><code>Usage()</code><br />
      : display a help text if parameters don't make sense</p>
      <p><code>ProcessArgs()</code><br />
      : to get our delay time from the command line</p>
      <p><code>Delay(count : INTEGER)</code><br />
      : a busy wait procedure</p>
      <p><code>SlowCat(count : INTEGER)</code><br />
      : take standard input and display like a teleprompter</p>
      <p><code>count</code><br />
      : is an integer holding our delay value (seconds of waiting) which is set by ProcessArgs()</p>
      <h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
      <p>Usage just wraps helpful text and display it to standard out.</p>
      <h2 id="processargs">ProcessArgs()</h2>
      <p>This a functional procedure. It uses two of Karl's extension<br />
      modules. It uses <code>extArgs</code> to retrieve the command line parameters<br />
      and <code>extConvert</code> the string value retrieved into an integer.<br />
      <code>ProcessArgs()</code> returns TRUE if we can successful convert the<br />
      command line parameter and set the value of count otherwise return<br />
      FALSE.</p>
      <h2 id="delayvar-count--integer">Delay(VAR count : INTEGER)</h2>
      <p>This procedure uses <code>Input0</code> to fetch the current epoch time<br />
      and counts the number of seconds until we've reached our delay<br />
      value. It's a busy loop which isn't ideal but does keep the<br />
      program simple.</p>
      <h2 id="slowcatvar-count-integer">SlowCat(VAR count: INTEGER);</h2>
      <p>This is the heart of our command line program. It reads<br />
      a line of text from standard input, if successful writes it<br />
      to standard out and then waits using delay before repeating<br />
      this process. The delay is only invoked when a reading a<br />
      line was successful.</p>
      <h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h2>
      <p>Here's a &quot;SlowCat&quot; program.</p>
      <pre><code>
          MODULE SlowCat;
            IMPORT In, Out, Input, Args := extArgs, Convert := extConvert;

            Out.String(&quot;SlowCat outputs lines of text delayed by&quot;);Out.Ln();
            Out.String(&quot;a number of seconds. It takes one parameter,&quot;);Out.Ln();
            Out.String(&quot;an integer, which is the number of seconds to&quot;);Out.Ln();
            Out.String(&quot;delay a line of output.&quot;);Out.Ln();

      <h2 id="oakwood-guidelines-and-pow">Oakwood Guidelines and POW!</h2>
      <p>Oberon and Oberon-2 were both used in creating and enhancing the<br />
      Oberon System(s) as well as for writing programs on other operating<br />
      systems (e.g. Apple's Mac and Microsoft Windows).<br />
      Implementing Oberon compilers on non Oberon Systems required clarification<br />
      beyond the specification. The Oakwood Guidelines were an agreement<br />
      between some of the important Oberon-2 compiler implementers which<br />
      attempted to fill in that gap while encouraging portability in<br />
      source code between operating systems. Portability was desirable<br />
      because it allowed programmers (e.g. students) to compile<br />
      and run their Oberon programs with minimal modification in any<br />
      environment where an Oakwood compliant compiler was available.</p>
      <p>Citation for Oakwood can be found in <a href="https://archive.org/details/oberonprogrammin00mhlb/page/n363/mode/2up?q=Oakwood+Guidlines">Oberon-2 Programming with Windows</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Kirk B.(ed): The Oakwood Guidelines for Oberon-2 Compiler Developers. Available via FTP from ftp.fim.uni-linz.ac.at, /pub/soft/pow-oberon/oakwood</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The FTP machine doesn't exist any more and does not appear to have been included in JKU's preservation plans. Fortunately the POW! website has been preserved.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.fim.uni-linz.ac.at/pow/pow.htm">POW!</a> was a<br />
      different approach. It was a compiler and IDE targeting<br />
      other than Oberon Systems (e.g. Windows and later Java). It was<br />
      intended to be used in a hybrid development environment and to<br />
      facilitate leveraging non-Oberon resources (e.g. Java classes,<br />
      native Windows API).  POW project proposed &quot;Opal&quot; which was a<br />
      super set of modules that went beyond Oakwood. Having skimmed<br />
      &quot;Oberon-2 Programming with Windows&quot; some may seem reasonable to<br />
      port to Oberon-07, others less so.</p>
      <p>Why Oakwood and POW? These efforts are of interest to Oberon-07<br />
      developers as a well worn path to write code that is easy to<br />
      compile on POSIX systems and on systems that are based on the<br />
      more recent <a href="http://www.projectoberon.com/">Project Oberon 2013</a>.<br />
      It enhances the opportunity to bring forward well written modules<br />
      from prior systems like <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Oberon/A2">A2</a><br />
      but implemented for the next generation of Oberon Systems<br />
      like <a href="https://github.com/io-core/io">Integrated Oberon</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="oakwood-pdf">Oakwood PDF</h3>
      <p>Finding a PDF of the original Oakwood guidelines is going to become<br />
      tricky in the future. It was created by Robinson Associates and the<br />
      copy I've read from 1995 includes a page saying not for distribution.<br />
      Which sorta makes sense in the era of closed source software<br />
      development. It is problematic for those of us who want to explore<br />
      how systems evolved.  The term &quot;Oakwood Guidelines&quot; is bandied about<br />
      after 1993 and several of the modules have had influence on the language<br />
      use via book publications.  I was able to find a PDF of the 1995<br />
      version of the guidelines at<br />
      <a href="http://www.math.bas.bg/bantchev/place/oberon/oakwood-guidelines.pdf">http://www.math.bas.bg/bantchev/place/oberon/oakwood-guidelines.pdf</a>.</p>
      <p>Here's a typical explanation of Oakwood from<br />
      <a href="http://www.edm2.com/index.php/The_Oakwood_Guidelines_for_Oberon-2_Compiler_Developers#The_Oakwood_Guidelines">http://www.edm2.com/index.php/The_Oakwood_Guidelines_for_Oberon-2_Compiler_Developers#The_Oakwood_Guidelines</a><br />
      for a description of Oakwood.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>The Oakwood Guidelines for the Oberon-2 Compiler Developers /These guidelines have been produced by a group of Oberon-2 compiler developers, including ETH developers, after a meeting at the Oakwood Hotel in Croydon, UK in June 1993</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><a href="http://www.edm2.com/index.php/The_Oakwood_Guidelines_for_Oberon-2_Compiler_Developers#The_Oakwood_Guidelines">http://www.edm2.com/index.php/The_Oakwood_Guidelines_for_Oberon-2_Compiler_Developers#The_Oakwood_Guidelines</a><br />
      (an OS/2 developer website) was helpful for providing details about Oakwood.</p>
      <p>It would have been nice if the Oakwood document had made its way<br />
      into either ETH's or JKU's research libraries.</p>
      <p>Leveraging prior art opens doors to the past and future. Karl has<br />
      done with this with the modules he provides with his OBNC compiler<br />
      project.</p>
