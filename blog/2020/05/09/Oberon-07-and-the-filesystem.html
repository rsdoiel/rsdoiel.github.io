<h1 id="oberon-07-and-the-file-system">Oberon-07 and the file
system</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2020-05-09 (updated: 2021-10-29)</p>
<p>This is the seventh post in the <a
href="../../04/11/Mostly-Oberon.html">Mostly Oberon</a> series. Mostly
Oberon documents my exploration of the Oberon Language, Oberon System
and the various rabbit holes I will inevitably fall into.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-files-in-oberon-07">Working with files in
Oberon-07</h2>
<p>In a POSIX system we often talk of opening files, writing and reading
files and close files. The Oberon language reflects a more Oberon System
point of view.</p>
<p>The Oberon System generally avoids modality in favor of action.
Modality is where a context must be set before a set of actions are
possible. The <code>vi</code> text editor is a “modal” editor. You are
in either edit (typing) mode or command mode. At the function level
POSIX’s <code>open()</code>, is also modal. You can open a file for
reading, open a file for writing, you can open a file for appending,
etc. The Oberon language and base modules avoids modality.</p>
<p>The Oberon System is highly interactive but has a very different idea
about code, data and computer resources. In POSIX the basic unit of code
is a program and the basic unit of execution is a program. In Oberon the
basic unit of code is the module and the basic unit of execution is the
procedure. Modules are brought into memory and persist. As a result it
is common in the Oberon System to need to have file representations that
can persist across procedure calls. It provides a set of abstractions
that are a little bit like views and cursors found in database systems.
In taking this approach Oberon language eschews modality at the
procedure level.</p>
<p>NOTE: Modules can be explicitly unload otherwise they persist until
the computer is turned off</p>
<h2 id="key-oberon-concepts">Key Oberon Concepts</h2>
<p>The following are exported in the <code>Files</code> module.</p>
<dl>
<dt>File</dt>
<dd>
is a handle to the representation of a file, a File and Rider form a
view into a file.
</dd>
<dt>Rider</dt>
<dd>
similar to a database cursor, it is the mechanism that lets you navigate
in a file
</dd>
<dt>New</dt>
<dd>
Creates a new file (in memory but not on disc).
</dd>
<dt>Registration</dt>
<dd>
Associates a file handle created with New with the file system. A file
must be registered to persist in the file system.
</dd>
<dt>Old</dt>
<dd>
Opens an existing file for use.
</dd>
<dt>Set</dt>
<dd>
Set the position of a rider in a file
</dd>
<dt>Pos</dt>
<dd>
Gets the position of a rider in a file
</dd>
<dt>Close</dt>
<dd>
Writes out unwritten buffers in file to disc, file handle is still value
as is the rider.
</dd>
<dt>Purge</dt>
<dd>
Sets a file’s length to zero.
</dd>
<dt>Delete</dt>
<dd>
Unregister the filename with the file system.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the Oberon Systems a file can be “opened” many times with only one
copy maintained in memory. This allows efficient operations across a
module’s procedures. Likewise a file can have one or more Riders
associated with it. Each rider can move through the file independently
operating on the common in memory file. If a file is created with
<code>New</code> but not registered it can be treated like an in-memory
temp file. Closing a file writes its buffers but the file remains
accessible through it handle and riders. If a file is not modified it
doesn’t need to be closed.</p>
<p>In POSIX we generally want to explicitly close the file when we’re
through. In the Oberon language we only need to close a file if we’ve
modified it.</p>
<p>The behavior of files and riders in Oberon creates interesting
nuances around deleting files. The Delete operation can in principle
happen multiple times before the file is deleted on disc. That is
because the file handles and riders may still be operating on it. To
know when a file is finally deleted when <code>Delete</code> procedure
is called it includes a results parameter. When that value is set to
zero by the <code>Delete</code> procedure you know your file has been
deleted.</p>
<p>The <code>Files</code> module provides a number of methods to read
and write basic Oberon types. These use the rider rather than the file
handle. Calling them automatically updates the riders position. The
procedures themselves map to what we’ve seen in the modules
<code>In</code> and <code>Out</code>.<br />
There are a few additional commands for file system house keeping such
as <code>Length</code>, <code>GetDate</code>, <code>Base</code>. See the
OBNC documentation for the <code>Files</code> module for details <a
href="https://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/Files.def.html"
class="uri">https://miasap.se/obnc/obncdoc/basic/Files.def.html</a>.</p>
<p>In the following examples we’ll be using the <code>Files</code>
module to create, update and delete a file called
<code>HelloWorld.txt</code>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-file">Creating a file</h3>
<p>The recipe we want to follow for creating a file is New (creates an
empty file in memory), Register (associations the filename with the file
system), Set the rider position, with the rider write our content and
with the file call close because we’ve have changed the file.</p>
<p>Like our origin <code>SayingHi</code> we’ll demonstrate this code in
a new module called <code>TypingHi.Mod</code>. Below is a procedure
called <code>WriteHelloWorld</code>. It shows how to create, write and
close the new file called “HelloWorld.txt”.</p>
<pre><code>
  PROCEDURE WriteHelloWorld;
    VAR
      (* Define a file handle *)
      f : Files.File;
      (* Define a file rider *)
      r : Files.Rider;
  BEGIN
    (* Create our file, New returns a file handle *)
    f := Files.New(&quot;HelloWorld.txt&quot;);
    (* Register our file with the file system *)
    Files.Register(f);
    (* Set the position of the rider to the beginning *)
    Files.Set(r, f, 0);
    (* Use the rider to write out &quot;Hello World!&quot; *)
    Files.WriteString(r, &quot;Hello World!&quot;);
    (* Write a end of line *)
    Files.Write(r, 10);
    (* Close our modified file *)
    Files.Close(f);
  END WriteHelloWorld;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="receipt-in-review">Receipt in review</h4>
<ul>
<li>New, creates our file</li>
<li>Register, associates the file handle with the file system</li>
<li>Set initializes the rider’s position</li>
<li>WriteString, writes our “Hello World!” to the file</li>
<li>Close, closes the file, flushing unwritten content to disc</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="working-with-an-existing-file">Working with an existing
file</h3>
<p>If we’re working with an existing file we swap <code>New</code> for a
procedure named <code>Old</code>. We don’t need to register the file
because it already exists. We still need to set our rider and we want to
read back the string we previously wrote. We don’t need to close it
because we haven’t modified it. To demonstrate a new procedure is added
to our module called <code>ReadHelloWorld</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
  PROCEDURE ReadHelloWorld;
    VAR
      f : Files.File;
      r : Files.Rider;
      (* We need a string to store what we have read *)
      src : ARRAY 256 OF CHAR;
  BEGIN
    (* Create our file, New returns a file handle *)
    f := Files.Old(&quot;HelloWorld.txt&quot;);
    (* Set the position of the rider to the beginning *)
    Files.Set(r, f, 0);
    (* Use the rider to write out &quot;Hello World!&quot; *)
    Files.ReadString(r, src);
    (* Check the value we read, if it is not the name, 
       halt the program with an error *)
    ASSERT(src = &quot;Hello World!&quot;);
  END ReadHelloWorld;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="receipt-in-review-1">Receipt in review</h4>
<ul>
<li>Old, gets returns a file handle for an existing file</li>
<li>Set initializes the rider’s position</li>
<li>ReadString, read our “Hello World!” string from the file</li>
<li>Check the value we read with an ASSERT</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="removing-a-file">Removing a file</h3>
<p>Deleting the file only requires knowing the name of the file. Like in
<code>ReadHelloWorld</code> we’ll use the built-in ASSERT procedure to
check if the file was successfully removed.</p>
<pre><code>
  PROCEDURE DeleteHelloWorld;
    VAR
      result : INTEGER;
  BEGIN
    (* Delete our file *)
    Files.Delete(&quot;HelloWorld.txt&quot;, result);
    (* Check our result, if not zero then halt program with error *)
    ASSERT(result = 0);
  END DeleteHelloWorld;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="receipt-in-review-2">Receipt in review</h4>
<ul>
<li>Delete the file setting a result value</li>
<li>Check the value with ASSERT to make sure it worked</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together.">Putting it all together.</h2>
<p>Here is the full listing of our module.</p>
<pre><code>
    MODULE TypingHi;
      IMPORT Files;
    
      PROCEDURE WriteHelloWorld;
        VAR
          (* Define a file handle *)
          f : Files.File;
          (* Define a file rider *)
          r : Files.Rider;
      BEGIN
        (* Create our file, New returns a file handle *)
        f := Files.New(&quot;HelloWorld.txt&quot;);
        (* Register our file with the file system *)
        Files.Register(f);
        (* Set the position of the rider to the beginning *)
        Files.Set(r, f, 0);
        (* Use the rider to write out &quot;Hello World!&quot; *)
        Files.WriteString(r, &quot;Hello World!&quot;);
        (* Write a end of line *)
        Files.Write(r, 10);
        (* Close our modified file *)
        Files.Close(f);
      END WriteHelloWorld;
    
      PROCEDURE ReadHelloWorld;
        VAR
          f : Files.File;
          r : Files.Rider;
          (* We need a string to store what we have read *)
          src : ARRAY 256 OF CHAR;
      BEGIN
        (* Create our file, New returns a file handle *)
        f := Files.Old(&quot;HelloWorld.txt&quot;);
        (* Set the position of the rider to the beginning *)
        Files.Set(r, f, 0);
        (* Use the rider to write out &quot;Hello World!&quot; *)
        Files.ReadString(r, src);
        (* Check the value we read, if it is not the name, 
           halt the program with an error *)
        ASSERT(src = &quot;Hello World!&quot;);
      END ReadHelloWorld;
    
      PROCEDURE DeleteHelloWorld;
        VAR
          result : INTEGER;
      BEGIN
        (* Delete our file *)
        Files.Delete(&quot;HelloWorld.txt&quot;, result);
        (* Check our result, if not zero then halt program with error *)
        ASSERT(result = 0);
      END DeleteHelloWorld;
    
    BEGIN
        WriteHelloWorld();
        ReadHelloWorld();
        DeleteHelloWorld();
    END TypingHi.

<h2 id="post-script-2021-10-29">Post Script, 2021-10-29</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2021 I had an email conversation with Jules. It
pointed out a problem in this implementation of Hello World. I had
incorrectly coded the end of line with
<code>Files.WriteString(r, 0AX);</code> this is wrong. At best it should
have been <code>Files.Write(r, 10);</code>. There remains an issues with
<code>Files.WriteString("Hello World!");</code>. The Oakwood module
<code>Files</code> defines “WriteString” to include the trailing NULL
character. This will be output in the file. It all depends on how close
to the Oakwood specification that your compiler implements the
<code>Files</code> module.</p>
