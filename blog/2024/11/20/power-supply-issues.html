Power Supply Issues</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2024-11-20</p>
<p>I have a Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 400. The former builds my
personal website and my <a
href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna">Antenna</a>. I use the latter
as a casual portable development box.</p>
<p>Over the last year or two I noticed I would get voltage warnings
popping up. Typical this was prevalent when I was compiling Go, Pandoc
or Deno. The power supply I was using was the Official Raspberry Pi 4
power supply that came with the Raspberry Pi Desktop Kit and Raspberry
Pi 400 Computer Kit. At first I thought the power supplies were going
bad or had become damaged. I tried replacing the power supply with one
of the extras I had picked up (power supplies can and do fail). Still
had problems with low voltage.</p>
<p>I did some digging but found nothing useful than the old
recommendations of making sure the power supplies were appropriately and
to spec. I did read somewhere in my searching that the official power
supplies didn’t have allot of headroom. This got me thinking. The
Raspberry Pi OS has been updated many times since I got these devices.
Maybe there are more power demands happening than I realized. I’ve also
moved away from using the internal micro SD cards to using an external
thumb drive to boot, that would place an additional power requirement on
the system.</p>
<p>I looked at <a href="https://www.pishop.us">PiShop.us</a> which is
linked from the Raspberry Pi website as an official retailer. They had
the official supplies that came with my kits but also had one that had a
higher wattage rating. I ordered <a
href="https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-27w-usb-c-power-supply-white-us/">Raspberry
Pi 27W USB-C Power Supply White US</a>. Connected it up to my Raspberry
Pi 400 via the powered monitor. Booted from the thumb drive and then
tried rebuilding Go from Go 1.19 that ships with Raspberry Pi OS
compiling Go 1.21.9 and 1.23.3 from source. No voltage errors. Looks
like I just out grew the stock power supply. If this remains working
without problems I will order another one and use it with my old Pi
Drive enclosure and my Pi 4. Keeping my fingers crossed.</p>
