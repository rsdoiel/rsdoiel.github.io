      <h1>A Text oriented web</h1>
      <p>By R. S. Doiel, 2024-02-25</p>
      <p>The web is a busy place. There seems to be a gestalt resonant at the moment on the web that can be summarized by two phrases, &quot;back to basics&quot; and &quot;simplification&quot;. It is not the first time I've seen this nor is it likely the last. This blog post describes a thought experiment about a simplification with minimal invention and focus on feature elimination. It's a way to think about the web status quo a little differently. My intention is to explore the implications of a more text centered web experience that could coexist as a subset of today's web.</p>
      <h2>The web's &quot;good stuff&quot;</h2>
      <p>I think the following could form the &quot;good stuff&quot; in a Crockford<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> sense of pairing things down to the essential.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>the transport layer should remain HTTP but be limited to a few methods (GET, POST and HEAD) and the common header elements (e.g. length, content-type come to mind)</li>
      <li>The trio of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is really complex, swap this out for Markdown augmented with YAML (Markdown and YAML already have a synergy in Markdown processors like Pandoc)</li>
      <li>A Web form is expressed using GHYITS<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, it is delimited in the Markdown document by the familiar &quot;<code>^---$</code>&quot; block element, web form content would be encoded as YAML in the body of the POST using the content type &quot;<code>application/x-yaml</code>&quot;.</li>
      <li>Content would be served using the <code>text/markdown; charset: utf-8</code> content type already commonly used to identify Markdown content distinct from <code>plain/text</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I need a nice name for describing the arrangement of Markdown+YAML over HTTP arrangement. Is the descriptive acronym for &quot;text oriented web&quot;, i.e. &quot;tow&quot;, enough? Does it already have a meaning in software or the web? Would the protocol be &quot;tow://&quot;? I really need something a bit more clever and catchy if this is going to proceed beyond a thought experiment.</p>
      <h2>Prototyping Options</h2>
      <p>A proof of concept could be possible using off the self web server and web browser. The missing parts would be setting up the web server to add the <code>text/markdown; charset: utf-8</code> header for &quot;<code>.md</code>&quot; files and to handle processing POST with a content type of <code>application/x-yaml</code>. Client side could be implemented in a static web page via JavaScript or WASM module. The JS/WASM could convert the Markdown+YAML into HTML rendering the &quot;tow&quot; content. The web form on submit would be intercepted by the JavaScript event handler and reformulated as a POST with a content type of <code>application/x-yaml</code>.</p>
      <p>Building a &quot;tow&quot; server and client should be straight forward in Go (probably many languages). The the standard &quot;http&quot; package can be used to implement the specialized http server. The <code>yaml.v3</code> package to process the YAML POST data. Similar you should be able to create a text client for the command line or even a GUI client via <a href="https://fyne.io">Fyne</a></p>
      <h2>Exploratory Questions</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>What does it mean to have a more text oriented web?</li>
      <li>What advantages could a text user interface have over a graphical user interface?</li>
      <li>Can &quot;tow&quot; provide enough simple interactivity to support interactive fiction?</li>
      <li>Could a simple specification be stated clearly in a few pages of text?</li>
      <li>What possibilities open up when a web browser can send a data structure via YAML to a service?</li>
      <li>Can we live with a simpler client than a modern evergreen web browser?</li>
      <li>With a conversation interaction model of &quot;listener&quot; and a &quot;speaker&quot;, does it make sense thinking in terms of client server architecture?</li>
      <li>How hard is it to support both traditional website and this minimal &quot;tow&quot; site using the same corpus?</li>
      <li>Can this be done sustainably?</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Extrapolations</h2>
      <p>From a thought experiment I can see how to implement this both from a proof of concept level but also from a service and viewer level. I think it even offers an opportunity to function in a peer to peer manner.  If we're focusing primarily on text then the storage requirements can be minimal and the service could even live in a database system like SQLite3 as a form of sandbox of content.  Leveraging HTTP/HTTPS means we don't need any special support for content traveling across the net. With a much smaller foot print you can scratch the itch of a simpler textual experience without the trackers, JavaScript ping backs, etc. It could re-emphasize the conversion versus broadcast metaphor popularized by the walled gardens.  It might provide a more satisifying experience on Mobile since the payloads delivered to the web browser could be much smaller.</p>
      <h2>What is needed to demonstrate a standalone &quot;tow&quot;?</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>A modified HTTP web server (easy to implement in Go and other languages)</li>
      <li>A viewer/browser, possible to implement via Fyne in Go or as a text application/command line interface in Go</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Why not Gopher or Gemini?</h2>
      <p>Tow is not there to replace anything, not Gopher, Not Gemini, the WWW. It is an exploration of a subset of the WWW protocols with a specific focused on textual interaction. I don't see why a server or browser couldn't support Gopher and Gemini as well as Tow. Given that Markdown can easily be rendered into Gem Text, and Markdown can be treated as plain text I suspect you should be able to support all three text rich systems from the same copy and easily derive a full HTML results if desired too.</p>
