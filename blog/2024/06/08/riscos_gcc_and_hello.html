<h1 id="risc-os-5.30-gcc-4.7-and-hello-world">RISC OS 5.30, GCC 4.7 and
Hello World</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2024-06-08 (updated: 2024-06-16)</p>
<p>Presently am I learning RISC OS 5.30 on my Raspberry Pi Zero W. I
want to write some programs and I learned C back in University. I am
familiar with C on POSIX systems but not on RISC OS. These are my notes
to remind myself how things work differently on RISC OS.</p>
<p>I found two resources helpful. First James Hobson had a YouTUBE
series on RISC OS and C programming. From this I learned about
allocating more space in the Task Window via the Tasks window display of
Next and Free memory. Very handy to know. Watching his presentation it
became apparent he was walking through some one’s tutorial. This lead to
some more DuckDuckGo searches and that is when I stumbled on Steve
Fryatt’s <a href="https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/wimp-prog">Wimp
Programming In C</a>. James Hobson’s series (showing visually) help and
the detail of Steve Fryatt’s tutorial helped me better understanding how
things work on RISC OS.</p>
<p>I think these both probably date from around 2016. Things have been
evolving in RISC OS since then. I’m not certain that OSLib today plays
the same role it played in 2016. Also in the case of Steve Fryatt’s
tutorial I’m not certain that the DDE and Norcroft compilers are
essential in the say way. Since I am waiting on the arrival of the ePic
SD Card I figured I’d get started using the GCC and tools available via
Packman and see how far I can get.</p>
<h2 id="getting-oriented">Getting oriented</h2>
<p>What I think I need.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Editor</li>
<li>C compiler</li>
<li>Probably some libraries</li>
</ol>
<p>You need an editor fortunately RISC OS comes with two,
<code>!Edit</code> and <code>!StrongED</code>. You can use both to
create C files since they are general purpose text edits.</p>
<p>You need a C compiler, GCC 4.7.4 is available via Packman. That is a
click, and download away so I installed that.</p>
<p>I had some libraries already installed so I skipped installing
additional ones since I wasn’t sure what was currently required.</p>
<h2 id="pick-a-simple-goal">Pick a simple goal</h2>
<p>When learning a new system I find it helpful to set simple goals. It
helps from feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>My initial goal is to understand how I can compile a program and run
it in the Task Window of RISC OS. The Task Window is a command line
environment for RISC OS much like a DOS Window was for MS Windows or the
Terminal is for modern macOS. My initial program will only use standard
in and out. Those come with the standard library that ships with the
compiler. Minimal dependencies simplifies things. That goes my a good
simple intial goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to understand the most minimal requirements to compile a C
program and run it in Task Window</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>The program below is a simple C variation on the “Hello World”
program tought to beginner C programers. I’ve added a minimal amount of
parameter handlnig to se how that works in the Task Window environment.
This program will say “Hello World!” but if you include parameters it
will say “Hi” to those too.</p>
<p>The code looks like this.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>

<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="op">}</span></span>

<p>In a POSIX system I would name this “HelloWorld.c”. On RISC OS the
“.” (dot) is a directory delimiter. There seems to be two approaches to
translating POSIX paths to RISC OS. Samba mounted resources seem to have
a simple substitution translatio. A dot used for file extensions in
POSIX becomes a slash. The slash directory delimiter becomes a dot.
Looking at it from the POSIX side the translation is flipped. A POSIX
path like “Project/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.c” becomes
“Project.HelloWorld.HelloWorld/c” in RISC OS.</p>
<p>In reading of the RISC OS Open forums I heard discussions about a
different approach that is more RISC OS centric. It looks like the
convention in RISC OS is to put the C files in a directory called “c”
and the header files in a directory called “h”. Taking that approach I
should instead setup my directory paths like “Project.HelloWorld.c”
which in POSIX would be “Project/HelloWorld/c”. It seems to make sense
to follow the RISC OS convensions in this case as I am not planning to
port my RISC OS C code to POSIX anytime soon and if I did I could easily
write a mappnig program to do that. My path to “HelloWorld” C source
should look like <code>$.Projects.C_Programming.c.HelloWorld</code>.</p>
<p>After storting this bit out it is time to see if I can compile a
simple program with GCC and run it in a Task Window. This is a summary
of my initial efforts.</p>
<p>First attempt steps</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open Task Window</li>
<li>run <code>gcc --version</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This failed. GCC wasn’t visible to the task window. Without
understanding what I was doing I decided maybe I need to launch
<code>!GCC</code> in <code>$.Apps.Development</code> directory. I then
tried <code>gcc --version</code> again in the Task Window and this time
the error was about not enough memory available. I looked the “Tasks”
window and saw plenty of memory was free. I did NOT realise you could
drag the red bar for “next” and increase the memory allocation for the
next time you opened a Task Window. I didn’t find that out until I did
some searching and stumbled on James Hobson’s videos after watching the
recent WROCC Wakefield Show held in Bedford (2024).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A clever thing about RISC OS is the graphical elements are not
strictly informational. Often they are actionable. Dragging is not
limited to icons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second attempt steps</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the Tasks window, drag the memory (red bar) allocation to be
more than 16K</li>
<li>Open a new Task Window</li>
<li>Find and Click on <code>!GCC</code></li>
<li>In the task window check the GCC version number</li>
<li>Change the directory in the Task Window to where I saved
“HelloWorld”</li>
<li>Check the directory with “cat”</li>
<li>Try to compile with <code>gcc HelloWorld -o app</code>, fails</li>
<li>Check GCC options with <code>--help</code></li>
<li>Try to compiled with <code>gcc -x c HelloWorld -o app</code>,
works</li>
</ol>
<p>This sequence was more successful. I did a “cat” on the task window
and saw I was not in the right folder where my “HelloWorld” was saved.
Fortunately James Hobson video shows any easy way of setting the working
directory. I brought the window forward that held “HelloWorld”. Then I
used the middle mouse button (context menu) to “set directory”. I then
switched back to the Task Window and low and behold when I did a “cat” I
could see my HelloWorld file.</p>
<p>I tried to compile “HelloWorld”. In James Hobson video he shows how
to do this but I couldn’t really see what he typed. When I tried this I
got an error about the file type not being determined. Doing
<code>gcc --help</code> listed the options and I spotted <code>-x</code>
can be used to explicitly set the type from the GCC point of view. This
is something to remember when using GCC. It’s a POSIX program running on
RISC OS which is not a POSIX system. GCC will expect files to have a
POSIX references in some case and not others. There’s a bit of trial and
error around this for me.</p>
<p>Next I tried using the <code>-x c</code> option. I try recompiling
and after a few moments GCC creates a “app” file in the current
directory. On initial creation it is a Textfile but then the icon
quickly switches to a “App/ELF” icon. Double clicking the App icon
displays hex code in the Task Window. Not what I was expected. Back in
the Task Window I type the following.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>app Henry Mable</code></pre>
<p>And I get out put of</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>Hello World!
Hi Henry
Hi Mable</code></pre>
<p>My program works at the CLI level in a Task Window. My initial goal
has been met.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Remember that RISC OS is a fully GUI system, things you do in
windows can change what happens in the whole environment</li>
<li>Remember that the display elements in the GUI maybe actionable</li>
<li>When I double clicked on <code>!GCC</code> what it did is add itself
to the search path.</li>
</ol>
<p>I remember something from the Hobson video about setting that in
<code>!Configure</code>, <code>!Boot</code> and picking the right boot
configuration action. I’ll leave that for next time. I should also be
able to script this in an Obey file and that might be a better
approach.</p>
<p>There are some things I learned about StrongED that were surprising.
StrongED’s C mode functions like a “folding” editor. I saw a red arrow
next to my “main” functions. If I click it the function folds up except
for the function signature and opening curly bracket. Click it again the
the arrow changes direction and the full function is visible again.</p>
<p>The “build” icon in StrongED doesn’t invoke GCC at the moment. I
think the build icon in the ribbon bar maybe looking for a Makefile. If
so I need to install Make from Packman. This can be left for next
time.</p>
<p>I’d really like to change the editor colors as my eyes have trouble
with white background. This too can be left for another day to figure
out.</p>
<h2 id="next-questions">Next Questions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>How do I have the GCC compiled “app” so that I can double click in
the file window and have it run without manually starting the Task
Window and running it from there. Is this a compiler option or do I need
an Obey file?</li>
<li>Which libraries do I need to install while I wait on the DDE from
ePic to arrive so that I can write a graphical version of Hello
World?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<p>I got a chance to read more about <a
href="https://www.riscosopen.org/wiki/documentation/show/CLI%20Basics">Obey
files</a> and also clicked through the examples in the
<code>SDSF::RISCOSPi.$.Apps.Development.!GCC</code> directory (shift
double click to open the GCC directory. In that directory is an examples
folder which contains a Makefile for compile C programs in various
forms. From there it was an easy stop to see how a simple Obey file
could be used to create a <code>!Build</code> and <code>!Cleanup</code>
scripts. where all the GCC setup lives). What follows are the two Obey
files in the directory holding the “c” folder of HelloWorld.</p>
<p>Here’s <code>!build</code></p>
<pre class="riscos"><code>| !Build will run GCC on c.HelloWorld to create !HelloWorld
Set HelloWord$Dir &lt;Obey$Dir&gt;
WimpSlot -min 16k
gcc -static -O3 -s -O3 -o !HelloWorld c.HelloWorld</code></pre>
<p>and <code>!Cleanup</code></p>
<pre class="riscos"><code>| !Cleanup removes the binaries created with !Build
Set HelloWorld$Dir &lt;Obey$Dir&gt;
Delete !HelloWorld</code></pre>
