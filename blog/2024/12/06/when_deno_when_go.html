<h1 id="when-denotypescript-when-go">When Deno+TypeScript, when Go?</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2024-11-06</p>
<p>Last month I gave a <a
href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/cold/presentations/presentation1.html">presentation</a>
on a project written in <a href="https://deno.com">Deno</a>+<a
href="https://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>. The project included
code that needed to be shared server and browser side. At the conclusion
of my talk the question came up, “When would I choose Go versus
Deno+TypeScript for a project?”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The answer I came up
with at the time was I would choose Deno+TypeScript when I needed to
share code between server and browser. That was the question that had
lead me to Deno in the first place. Deno+TypeScript shared many of the
advantages of Go<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. I like writing in Go. The weak
point in my Go based projects I thought was limited to porting Go code
to JavaScript when I needed it run browser side. I went home and slept
well that night. Since then I have been reflecting a little more on the
question.</p>
<p>Learning Go isn’t difficult and the learning resources are pretty
good. I find Go well suited to the library and archive software domain.
I believe typed languages are good for working with structured metadata.
Go compiles to a binary and is trivial to deploy. Go has really good
tooling making it easier to write better quality code.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I all know Python. Python is our language of
collaboration. I’m the only one that knows Go on our team of four. The
leap from Python to Go isn’t huge but it is a leap. I made that leap
because I needed the features that Go provided at the time<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
Since that time the uptake in libraries and archives of coding in Go has
been minimal<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I know JavaScript. Most of the people I’ve met
through Code4Lib know JavaScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript
and Deno can compile it<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. The path from JavaScript to
TypeScript is less of a leap and more of a stretch. Valid JavaScript is
valid TypeScript after all.</p>
<p>Learning Deno command is easy and not a big ask. It is certainly
allot easier learning Deno than Git. Git knowledge has grown over the
decade that I’ve known the Code4Lib community. I suspect Deno will be
easier to adopt. When I take software sustainability into consideration
I suspect those projects I write in Deno+TypeScript may out live the
ones I’ve written in Go.</p>
<p>In hindsight I don’t think my answer about sharing code between
browser and server is the whole criteria. Libraries and archives tend to
have a small team to zero software development staff. While Go is a very
popular language in 2024 few writing software for libraries and archives
know it. Go adoption in our community hasn’t materialized. In the
meantime most of the people I’ve met via Code4Lib know JavaScript. The
Go developers I know of in our community also know JavaScript.</p>
<p>TypeScript is a small stretch to pickup if you know JavaScript.
TypeScript has good, free, online documentation<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.
TypeScript is by definition a superset of JavaScript. If your project
requires participation by other developers and you choose
Deno+TypeScript over Go you have a wider pool of possible helping hands.
Deno+TypeScript gives most of the benefits that Go offers today. I think
this is compelling for software sustainability.</p>
<p>When would I pick Deno+TypeScript over Go? I now have three criteria
questions I ask myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I need to share code between browser and server?
<ul>
<li>If yes, maybe this is a Deno+TypeScript project.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do I need to largest pool of programmers available to lend a hand?
<ul>
<li>If yes, maybe this is a Deno+TypeScript project.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do I want to require Go knowledge to participate in the project?
<ul>
<li>If yes then it might be a Go project.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If my answers are “yes”, “yes”, “no” then the project should proceed
with Deno+TypeScript. If I answer the last one is “no” then it shouldn’t
be a Go project.</p>
