<h1 id="setting-up-my-raspberry-pi-500-a-portable-workstation">Setting
up my Raspberry Pi 500, a Portable Workstation</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2025-02-14</p>
<p>I’m writing this on a newly setup Raspberry Pi 500. So far I’m
impressed. I was sceptical about moving from my Pi 400 but when it died
I was forced to upgrade. It has been worth it.</p>
<p>I’ve now had a chance to install the various pieces of software I
regularly use. Even do some web browsing with it. Image some SD cards
for a RISC OS project I’m working on. It feels much quicker than my Pi
400. I think the speed increase is in part the faster CPU but I suspect
the program I am running is taking advantage of the 8 Gig RAM instead of
the old 4. As I’ve testing this machine out I noticed I had stopped
asking myself the question about launching more than one large program
at a time (e.g. my browser is running and being used as I type this in
VS Code). When I tried VS Code on my Pi 4B+ and 400 it just felt too
sluggish. I’m typing this review in VS Code now on the Pi 500 is keeping
up OK.</p>
<p>When I purchased the Pi-500 and I also decided to go with the new
Raspberry Pi Monitor. Together I have a complete portable workstation.
While my previous powered WaveShare monitor was higher resolution the Pi
Monitor it also used allot more power. With the combination of Pi
Monitor and Pi-500 I am now contemplating exploring power consumption so
I can find a one battery to power the monitor and Pi-500.</p>
<p>Here’s the spec and pricing for this new machine. Some parts I didn’t
purchase because I already owned them (e.g. the 27W Pi power supply) but
I have included the list prices for those who might be interested.</p>

<h2 id="software-setup">Software Setup</h2>
<p>I created an “image” on my 128G SD Card using the Raspberry Pi Imager
on another computer. The imager lets you setup initial user account,
WiFi configuration and whether you want SSH services running the first
boot. I like using the vanilla 64 bit Raspberry Pi OS distribution. I
picked the one for the Raspberry Pi 5 series.</p>
<p>When I booted the Pi-500 connected to the Pi Monitor it seemed to
cause the screen to cycle through and Pi splash page a few times. Once
it completed its first boot it hasn’t done that again. I am assuming
that was some negotiation between the monitor and the Pi. After a quick
click around test I rebooted the machine by doing a full shutdown and
power off and the power back up.</p>
<h3 id="development-and-writing-software">Development and Writing
Software</h3>
<p>I am planning to use the Pi-500 as a light weight development machine
and as a machine for preparing updates for my blog. I installed the
additional software below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pandoc 3 via installed via deb package from Pandoc GitHub
releases</li>
<li>Rust installed via Rustup</li>
<li>PageFind installed via Cargo</li>
<li>Flatlake installed via Cargo</li>
<li>htmlq installed via Cargo</li>
<li>ncal installed via Cargo</li>
<li>Deno installed via website using CURL</li>
<li>Go installed via website’s tar ball</li>
<li>jq installed via apt</li>
<li>SQLite3, libsqlite3-dev installed via apt</li>
<li>Hunspell and US English dictionary installed via apt</li>
</ul>
<p>The “build-essential” package was already installed. I noticed that
Git and GNU Make were immediately available with my first boot.</p>
<p>I this setup as a portable workstation. It feels quick and snappy but
is small enough to toss in computer bag. I did test compile a few
things. It is possible to peg the CPU but then again it’s a little
machine after all. I didn’t get any warning lights or notifications like
I used to on the Pi-400.</p>
<p>With a connection to my home WiFi network (not a fast connection) it
took me about an hour or so to download and install all my extras. This
was quicker than the last time I setup a Pi. Some of the time saved was
the better hardware and net work performance but much of the time saved
was due to the fact that I did not have to compile software from
scratch. That was a change from the last time I setup a Pi up. I guess
Pi and aarch64 processors are common enough that projects are now
including it in their regular builds.</p>
<p>If I pickup the right capacity battery I suspect I will have a lovely
deconstructed Laptop to use as a portable workstation.</p>
