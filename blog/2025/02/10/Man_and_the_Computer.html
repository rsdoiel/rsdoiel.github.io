<h1 id="book-review-man-and-the-computer">Book review, “Man and the
Computer”</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2025-02-10</p>
<p>Open Library has a wonderful collection of classic Computer related
texts. This is a review of one of them. “Man and the Computer” was
written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Kemeny">John
G. Kemeny</a> and published in 1972. The book covers the evolution of
the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) and BASIC<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It is an interesting weekend read. You can read the text at <a
href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL5282840M/Man_and_the_computer">Open
Library</a>. The book is short (160 pages or so). It is written for
casual reading like a talk given to a small group.</p>
<p>The first part goes into the innovations that resulted for the
undergraduate students who used, developed and extended the systems. The
later part of the book covers what the implications of the system had
been by the 1970s and what it suggestions for the future through 1990.
Given that the book was written before DARPAnet, before Internet and
before “Personal Computers” a surprising amount of the Kemeny’s
predictions were on target and remaining relevant today. He anticipated
Open Access and Cloud Computing and the benefits the were possible. My
take away is it is a charming reflection of where computing was at for
Dartmouth and its alumni in the start of the 1970s.</p>
<p>Stepping back to a bigger picture of computing in the 1960s and 1970s
the book does have blind spots. This is not surprising because the
communications were so much more restrictive before the Internet in
terms of technical exchange in computing. It is no wonder that there is
but one line that mentions the innovations in time-sharing that occurred
at RAND with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOSS">Johniac
Open Shop System</a> (aka. JOSS-1, JOSS-2). They system have some
parallels with the early DTSS/BASIC incarnations and may have preceded
by as much as a few years<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. JOSS lead to other systems like
CAL, PIL/I, FOCAL and MUMPs. The later, like JOSS, bare similarities to
what would be developed at Dartmouth in the form of BASIC.</p>
<p>It is quite reasonable for this text to the have these blind spots.
First it was not intended to be a history of computing (see the Preface
of the book) but rather a high level look at what the promise was for
people who could work interactively with a computer. I feel it gives
insights into the early era where computing access was rapidly
increasing and the sense of promise that carried. Well worth the reading
time if you’re a hobbyist or arm chair computer history buff.</p>
