<h1 id="powershell-and-edit-on-windows-macos-and-linux">PowerShell and
Edit on Windows, macOS and Linux</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2025-06-05</p>
<p>One of the challenges of multi platform support is the variance in
tools. Unix and related operating systems are pretty unified these days.
The differences are minor today as opposed to twenty years ago. If you
need to support Windows too it’s a whole different story. You can jump
to Linux Subsystem for Windows but that is really like using a container
inside Windows and doesn’t solve the problem when you need to work
across the whole system.</p>
<p>Windows’ shell experience is varied. Originally it was command com,
essentially a enhanced CP/M shell. Much later as Windows moved beyond
then replaced MS-DOS they invented PowerShell. Initially a Windows only
system. Fast forward today things have change. PowerShell runs across
Windows, macOS and Linux. It is even licensed under an MIT style
license.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>PowerShell is intended as a system scripting language and as such is
focused on the types of things you need too to manage a system. It has
vague overtones of Java, .NET and F#. If you are familiar with those it
probably feels familiar for me it wasn’t familiar. Picking up PowerShell
has boiled down to my thinking I can do X in Bash then doing a search to
find out the equivalent in PowerShell 7 or above. There are something
examples out there that are Windows specific because there isn’t a
matching service under that other operating systems but if you focus on
PowerShell itself rather than Windows particular feature it is very
useful. It also means while you’re picking up how Windows might approach
something you can re-purpose that knowledge on the other operating
systems. That’s really handy for admin type tasks.</p>
<p>One of the things I’ve been playing with is creating a set of scripts
that have a common name but deal with the specifics of the target OS.
That way when I need to run a generalized task I can deploy the OS
specific version to the platform but then start thinking about managing
the heterogeneous environments in a unified way. E.g. scripts like
“require-reboot.ps1”, “safe-to-reboot.ps1”, “disk-is-used-by.ps1”.</p>
<p>Once you start getting serious about learning a system admin script
language you also learn you need to vet the quality of your the scripts
you are writing. On Unix I use a program called <a
href="https://www.shellcheck.net/">shellcheck</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/patrickvane/shfmt">shfmt</a> to format my
scripts. How do you do that for Powershell?</p>
<p>Recently I discovered recently is PSScriptAnalyzer. Like shellcheck
it will perform static analysis on your script and let you know of
lurking issues to be aware of. The beauty of it is I can evaluate a
script in PowerShell on macOS and know that I’ve caught issues that
would have pinched me if I ran it Linux or Windows. That’s kinds of
sweet.</p>
<p>You need to <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/utility-modules/psscriptanalyzer/overview?view=ps-modules">install
PSScriptAnalyzer</a> but it is easy to do under PowerShell.</p>
<pre class="pwsh"><code>Install-Module -Name PSScriptAnalyzer -Force</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="pwsh"><code>Install-PSResource -Name PSScriptAnalyzer -Reinstall</code></pre>
<p>If I want <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/utility-modules/psscriptanalyzer/using-scriptanalyzer?view=ps-modules&amp;source=recommendations">run
the analyzer</a> on a script called <code>installer.ps1</code> I’d run
lit like</p>
<pre class="psh"><code>Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path ./installer.ps1 -Settings PSGallery -Recurse</code></pre>
<p>Formatting PowerShell scripts I am currently testing out <a
href="https://github.com/DTW-DanWard/PowerShell-Beautifier">PowerShell-Beautifier</a>.
It’s a “cmdlet” and an easy install into PSGallery following the
instructions in the GitHub repo.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of formatting the previous example so it uses tabs
instead of spaces.</p>
<pre class="pwsh"><code>Edit-DTWBeautifyScript ./installer.ps1 -IndentType Tabs</code></pre>
<h1
id="now-that-i-got-a-shell-running-across-systems-what-about-an-editor">Now
that I got a shell running across systems, what about an editor?</h1>
<p>MS-DOS acquired an editor called “edit” at some point in time
(version 4 or 5?). I remember it was a simple full screen non model
editor. Recently Microsoft has created a similar editor that runs in a
terminal on Windows and Linux. Like PowerShell it arrived as an Open
Source Project. You don’t mind some rough edges I have compiled it
successfully on macOS. A few features are not implemented but it can
open and save files. It builds with the latest Rust (e.g. run
<code>rustup update</code> if you haven’t in a while) and generates an
installable executable using Cargo. While I’m not likely to switch
editors it’s nice to have one that is really cross platform in doesn’t
require odd Unix adapter libraries to be installed to compile it. It’s
just a Rust program so like Go the build process is pretty consistent
when you compile on Windows, Linux or macOS.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/edit"
class="uri">https://github.com/Microsoft/edit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So you have an administrative shell environment and a common editor.
If you happen to have to document admin chores across systems at least
now you can document one admin language and editor and know it’ll run if
installed.</p>
