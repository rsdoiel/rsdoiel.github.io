# Two recent articles on working with Large Language Models

By R. S. Doiel, 2025-09-10

I've recently read two articles on Large Language Models which I think explain clearly some of the issues around using LLM in developing software.

- [AI: Why generative AI hallucinate. all the causes you should know](https://paolozaino.wordpress.com/2025/09/09/ai-why-generative-ai-hallucinates-all-the-causes-you-should-know/) by Paolo Fabio Zaino
- [Building AI-Resistant Technical Debt](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/building-ai-resistant-technical-debt/) by Andrew Stellman

What I liked about these articles is they present the challenges in clear language that is readable by both software writer and lay people who are familiar with using a computer. The later is really helpful when collaborating with non-developers or with management. I think we're still in the "AI is hammer and all problems are nails" phase of the hype cycle around large language models and these types of articles help break the spin. Nicely done.
