<h1 id="rss-23-years-on">RSS 23 years on</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2025-09-11</p>
<p>I think Dave’s post, <a
href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/11/123936.html?title=itsReallySimple">It’s
Really Simple</a>, is an important read. It’s shortness lends itself to
reflection. <strong>Dave takes the long view.</strong> I think that is
very healthy for the web. It’s a view I’ve increasingly embraced over
the last decade or three.</p>
<p>Dave’s post points out 23 years after the introduction of RSS we
could have seen much more creativity. In 2025 the primary contribution
of web corporations is to stifle innovation. The “network effect” is
their business model.They insure we’re are both tenant and product. Is
the solution to make complex standards that embrace the characteristics
that enabled the walled gardens in the first place? I think RSS 2.0,
twenty three years later, still provides a better path forward.</p>
<p>Do we want to be both tenant and product? If so than perhaps ATProto
or ActivityPub make sense. RSS’s path is far simpler. I don’t think it
is accidental that both Mastodon and BlueSky embraced RSS output. In
2025 lots of languages come with mature RSS libraries. Even if you need
to write your own the spec is simple enough to do so.</p>
<p>Here are three systems I think show the longevity and possibility of
RSS. Dave Winer’s <a href="https://feedland.org">FeedLand</a>, Matt
Mullenweg’s <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a>, and Andrew
Shell’s port of rssCloud support from Frontier to a standalone server,
<a href="https://rpc.rsscloud.io/">rssCloud v2</a><a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
The FeedLand and WordPress show us user facing content systems with real
inter-opt. Andrew’s rssCloud shows us how to build a real time RSS
service without tying it into a content management system directly.
These are examples of a social web we can own. We’re just not calling
them that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RSS 2.0 is for the long view. As the car commercial used to say,
“it’s built to last”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think BlueSky and Mastodon missed the boat skipping support for RSS
2.0 as input. I think part of the problem was how they were guided to
re-implement a solution from walled gardens as an open source project. A
common characteristic of systems developed by X, Meta and Google was
complexity. For those companies the complexity was useful. I don’t think
we need that complexity if we are not building walled gardens. This
missed opportunity was to assumed the “network effect” was the goal. I
think communication is the goal. It can exists without scaling out to
centralized walled gardens.</p>
<p>Here’s a thought experiment, “Do complex protocols lend themselves to
a diversity of implementations? Are they better suited to preservation?”
I think the answer is no. I can read and process a tab delimited file
from the 1970s or a comma delimited one from the 1980s. Why? It’s a
simple format. Simple is preservation friendly. I am certain I’ll be
able to read and process an RSS 2.0 file in 2050. Why, it’s a simple
standard. I don’t think I’ll be able to do that with the complex
alternatives. My guess is they fall out of favor overtime and fade
precisely because they’re complex. Simple is a built-in preservation
quality.</p>
<p>RSS 2.0 is stable and extensible. It has enabled Podcasting which
Apple, YouTube and Spotify have yet to wall off. Podcasting, whether
audio, video or text, offers us a way out. RSS allows us to say goodbye
to the gate keepers like X, Meta, Google, Apple et el. We don’t need a
<strong>Web 3.0</strong>. What we need to embrace is the web and
internet as common nouns. Write and deploy from our own machines.
Connect them through the networks and eventually land content on the
<strong>Web</strong> or <strong>Internet</strong> based on open
standards and inter-opt. Let’s skip the business models of wall gardens
this time around.</p>
<p>When people mention the foundations of the web they typically mention
HTTP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript as if their are just four pillars of the
web. I think they are missing a fifth column, RSS 2.0. It provides the
proven means of an open syndication system that continues to work after
23 years.</p>
<p>The final reflection I’d like to focus on in Dave’s post is Markdown.
Markdown is a hypertext document format that is easier to type and proof
read than HTML. I think it is where an alternative to the walled gardens
can shine. It works as an enclosure in the <a
href="https://textcasting.org">Textcasting</a> context. Markdown with
front matter allows non-programmers to manage the metadata associated
with their documents be they blog posts or academic papers<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
It’s a simple format, simpler than HTML. It’s a format that lends itself
to preservation in much the same way RSS 2.0 does.</p>
<p>In my own modest effort to create <a
href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/antennaApp"
title="antennaApp is a feed oriented static content system build around Markdown and RSS 2.0">the
writing environment I want</a>, I have relied on Markdown and RSS 2.0.
Why? Because RSS 2.0 is a stable spec. I’ve embraced <a
href="https://commonmark.org">CommonMark</a> alongside with John
Grubber’s <a
href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> for
writing because I can proof read it easier than proof reading HTML. It’s
a format you can read without conversion and if you do want to render as
HTML that is easy to do too. With Markdown I can start something on my
phone in a simple text editor. I can add that document to my blog to be
rendered as HTML or into an RSS 2.0 feed. When I do so it all works
because of inter-opt provided by RSS 2.0.</p>
<p>The web of 2025 can be open if we choose to open it up. Embrace not
the “Web” as proper noun owned by corporations but the “web” as a common
noun which we can also own a part. Step out the silos and see the wild
lands of the real web. See their beauty and create them for
yourself.</p>
