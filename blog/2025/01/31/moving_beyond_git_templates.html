<h1 id="moving-beyond-git-template-repositories-with-codemeta">Moving
beyond git template repositories with CodeMeta</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2025-01-31 (updated: 2025-02-03)</p>
<p>A nice feature of GitHub is the ease in starting a new repository
with a complete set of documents<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. This feature creates a
problem. The “template” documents require editing. Then they require
more editing to keep them from being stale. If you’re serious about
keeping documentation up to date then the copy edit work must be
continuous. Copy edit work is tedious. Is there a path beyond the git
repository templates that avoid stale <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)">software
artifacts</a>?</p>
<p>Existing development tools suggestion a solution. For decades
software developers have had tools to extract documentation from the
comments in source code. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Knuth</a> pioneered
this with his <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate
programming</a> approach. A simplified take on this is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc">Javadoc</a> used in the
Java programming community. Today most open source programming languages
have similar tools available. In 2025 it is trivial to generate source
code documentation directly from the comments in your source code. Can
an approach like this be used for more of our software artifacts?</p>
<p>I believe leveraging <a href="https://codemeta.github.io"
title="See the section titled, Motivation">CodeMeta</a>, developed by
the research programming community, gives us a path forward for general
software development.</p>
<h2><a name="how-is-codemeta-relevant">How is CodeMeta relevant?</a></h2>
<p>The CodeMeta data is meant to be machine readable and human
manageable. That’s a developer sweet spot. The CodeMeta object let’s you
track metadata like name, description, version, authorship and
contributors. It includes where the project source repository is hosted
and the license used. Over time the list of metadata attributes in the
CodeMeta object has grown. Today we have a long list of a project’s
metadata that can be tracked and acted upon.</p>
<p>When I started including CodeMeta files in my projects at Caltech
Library I did so at software release. It was a task to do at the end of
the process like the task of reviewing and updating the cloned
documentation files. Treating the CodeMeta as an after thought created a
burden. It was a disincentive to adopting CodeMeta.</p>
<p>I think we make the CodeMeta object relevant to developers by
treating it as primary source code. Editing it should be the first
rather than last thing updated before a release. <strong>An accurate
CodeMeta file is actionable.</strong> Ignored this and you ignore
CodeMeta’s super power.</p>
<p>Can CodeMeta be used to help lower the documentation burden? Yes.</p>
<p>In 2025 there is enough information in a complete CodeMeta object to
create structured documents. This includes documents like a README and
INSTALL. Keeping track of the content as metadata can lower the effort
in managing stale documentation. It may be enough to eliminate the need
for git template repositories. At a minimum it can shrink what is needed
from template repositories.</p>
<p>Here’s the steps I used to take setting up a project.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write the README</li>
<li>Document how the software will work</li>
<li>Write tests to confirm the software works</li>
<li>Write the software</li>
<li>Create/update my software artifacts to reflect the current state
such as the codemeta.json file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat as needed. The last step was always tedious. The longer a
project is around the more artifacts need to be managed. It was easy to
want to short cut that last step.</p>
<p>Here’s what I have been experimenting with.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create or update the CodeMeta file</li>
<li>Document or update how the software should work</li>
<li>Create or update tests to confirm the software works as
documented</li>
<li>Write or update the software to pass the tests</li>
<li><strong>Generate</strong> additional software artifacts from the
CodeMeta document.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step five is automated. In practice step five can be integrated with
your standard build processes. Us humans focus on steps one through
four. Life just got a little easier for the busy developer.</p>
<p>Several questions are suggested by this proposal.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How do I make it easy to create and update the CodeMeta file?</li>
<li>How do I generate the software artifacts?</li>
<li>What artifacts can be generated in a reliable way?</li>
</ol>
<p>The CodeMeta object is stored as a JSON document in your repository.
That means you can readily build tooling around it.</p>
<p>Today you can use the CodeMeta <a
href="https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/">generator</a> to
bootstrap the creation of a CodeMeta file. If you’re willing to do some
cut and paste work the generator can even be used to maintain your
CodeMeta file.</p>
<p>What about generating our artifacts?</p>
<p>For the last few years I’ve relied on Pandoc templates, see <a
href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/codemeta-pandoc-examples">codemeta-pandoc-examples</a>.
I use Pandoc and these templates to generate files like CITATION.cff,
about.md, installer scripts and version files for the Python, Go and
TypeScript programming languages. The trouble with this approach is
Pandoc tends to be well knowing in the data science community but not in
the general developer community. The Pandoc template language is
obscure. This has lead me to believe new tools are needed beyond Pandoc
and templates.</p>

<h2><a name="cmtools">CMTools</a></h2>
<p>I recently started prototyping two programs for working with <a
href="https://codemeta.github.io">CodeMeta</a> objects. The prototype
code is available at <a
href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/CMTools">github.com/caltechlibrary/CMTools</a>.
The two programs are for editing (<code>cme</code>) and for transforming
(<code>cmt</code>) the CodeMeta object. I am currently testing the
prototypes in selected Caltech Library projects.</p>
<h3 id="what-challenges-have-the-prototypes-raise">What challenges have
the prototypes raise?</h3>
<p>The CodeMeta object is sprawling. <code>cme</code> was started as
command line alternative to the generator. It was initially designed
with an interactive, prompt and response, user interface. It would
iterate over all the top level attributes prompting for changes. This
can be tedious. I quickly added support to shorten the process by
including a list of specific attributes to edit.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>cme codmeta.json                       # &lt;-- iterate over all
cme codemeta.json version dateModified # &lt;-- just listed attributes</code></pre>
<p>The prompt and response approach works well for simple attribute
types like name, description and version. The more complex attributes
like author or contributor were challenging. To avoid the need to
increase the types of prompts or be forced into a menu system I’m
experimenting with using YAML to display the current value and accept
YAML as the user response. YAML is much easier to type and copy edit
than JSON. It is easy to transform into JSON. The downside is you need
to know the structure and attribute names ahead of time. That gives
<code>cme</code> a training cost.</p>
<p>Multi line values are tricky to work with if you rely on standard
input. To address this I added a feature to allow the use the editor of
your choice. If you are on macOS or Linux the default editor is nano. On
Windows it is notepad.exe. You can pick a different editor by setting
the EDITOR environment variable. In the example below I’ve chosen the <a
href="https://micro-editor.github.io">Micro Editor</a> for setting
values. It didn’t solve the problem of knowing the YAML attributes in
advance but does make it easier to copy edit the YAML. Micro Editor is
Open Source and available for macOS, Linux and Windows. Support for
other editors could be added. Further prototyping and development work
is needed to support alternatives to editing YAML.</p>
<p>On macOS and Linux</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>export EDITOR=micro
cme codemeta.json author -e</code></pre>
<p>or on Windows</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode ps1"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">Set-Variable</span> EDITOR micro</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cme codemeta<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">json</span> author <span class="op">-</span>e</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the 0.0.9 release of the <code>cme</code> prototype I added the
ability to set the attribute values from the command line. This has
helped in automated environments. CodeMeta attribute name is used as the
key. An equal sign, “=”, is the delimiter. What follows the equal sign
is treated as the value. This works well for simple fields,
e.g. version, dateModified.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>cme codemeta.json version=&quot;0.0.2&quot; dateModified=&quot;2025-01-30&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Complex attribute editing using this approach is very
challenging.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-cmtools-generate">What can CMTools generate?</h3>
<p>The <code>cmt</code> prototype has limited abilities. It can render
about.md and CITATION.cff files. It can generate “version” source code
files for Python (version.py), Go (version.go), TypeScript (version.ts)
and JavaScript (version.js). I am actively working on porting the
remaining Pandoc templates from codemeta-pandoc-examples to
<code>cmt</code>. README and INSTALL will be added after the template
port is complete.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>cmt codemeta.json about.md CITATION.cff version.py \\
  README.md INSTALL.md installer.sh installer.ps1</code></pre>
<h2><a name="whats-next">What’s next?</a></h2>
<p>CMTools is at an early stage of development (January 2025). The
project is focused finding the balance of editing and generating.
Improvements will flow base on our usage.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/CMTools/releases/tag/v0.0.14">v0.0.14
release</a> includes the basic features discussed in this post for both
<code>cme</code> and <code>cmt</code>. RSD 2025-02-03</p>
