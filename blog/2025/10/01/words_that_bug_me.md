# Computer related words that bug me

Sometimes specific terms bug me on popular usage. This is particularly true when related to computer science (or better term, information science). 

Two terms really grate on my nerves these days.

1. “AI” was a marketing term to get the DOD to fund researching in to cognitive approaches to computation.  The generals like the term Artificial Intelligence in the 1970s because the idea of robot solders who could be destroyed with out the having to write the letters to their parents was desirable after Vietnam and previous wars. For the researchers it was sufficiently vague to be a goldmine of grant possibilities.
2. Information Security became Cyber Security for marketing reasons

Terms that change for marketing reasons quickly loose meaning. In the computers as communication devices space this isn't a good feature.

The stupidest phrase I've heard a politician and business leaders say in interviews, "We've got to have cyber".  In my head I change "cyber" to "coffee" so I don't think have to remember their names.
