title: Build a CommonMark Processor
abstract: >
  In this post I go over the process of building a TypeScript module called
  `commonMarkDoc.ts` along with a simple command line CommonMark processor
  called `cmarkprocess`.

  CommonMark pre-processor features are

    - support `@include-code-block` for including code samples as code blocks
    - support `@include-text-block` for include plain text into a CommonMark document
    - transform Hashtags into front matter
    - transform @Tags into front matter
keywords:
  - CommonMark
  - Markdown
  - Front Matter

# Building a CommonMark Processor in Deno+TypeScript

By R. S. Doiel, 2025-07-26

CommonMark and Markdown are easier to proof read and edit than HTML. CommonMark is a super set of John Grubber's original Markdown. It incorporates common practices and extensions to the original Markdown. I've found over the years the "Markdown" I type is really "CommonMark". I use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) for processing my CommonMark documents into HTML. There are a few transforms I'd like to make before I send the text off to Pandoc. That is what I'll be covering.

My CommonMark Processor will be responsible for several things. The features I miss are simple. Here's the short list.

- support `@include-code-block` for including code samples as code blocks
- support `@include-text-block` for include plain text into a CommonMark document
- transform Hashtags into front matter
- transform web Mentions into front matter

My homepage is built from a sequence of plain text files.
I also commonly need to include source code in my blog posts.  That has lead me to think about an include mechanisms. A source file should be included in a CommonMark code block while plain text can be included as is. 

The include blocks, text and code, can also be detected through regular expression. The difference for those is they require reading files from disk. That needs to be handled.

Here's the syntax I'd use for code block and included texts.

  > `@include-code-block` `FILEPATH [LANGUAGE]`

  > `@include-text-block` `FILEPATH`

Finally I'd to add support for [Hashtags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag) and web [Mentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mention_(blogging)). I want to explore integrating both with facets in search results, for that I'll need to track them in the front matter. Overtime I'll explore new features. The `commonMarkDoc.ts` module needs to be simple to extend.

How do I extract Hashtags and Mentions? Both are function similar though are used for different purposes. A regular expression should be suitable to pick them out. The difference between extracting a Hashtag or a Mention is the prefix, "#" or "@". A function that code use the supplied text and prefix could return a list of tagged results.

I want to easily extend the processor. I can create modules based on the transforms I need. Each module will include a function that implements the transform. The `process` method will be responsible for sequencing the transforms and updating the CommonMark object with the results.

What do I need in my CommonMark document object? I need to take the markup, parse it and have the object holding the CommonMark document split into front matter and content. Similarly I will need to reassemble the parts into back into a CommonMark text.  Those functions will be called `parse` and `stringify`. These names are idiomatic in JavaScript and TypeScript. The object type will be called `CommonMarkDoc`.

Here is the basic outline of the `CommonMarkDoc` object without the `process` method.

~~~TypeScript

 * 
 */
import * as yaml from "@std/yaml";

import { extractTags, mergeTags } from "./extractTags.ts";
import { includeCodeBlock } from "./includeCodeBlock.ts";
import { includeTextBlock } from "./includeTextBlock.ts";

export class CommonMarkDoc {
  frontMatter: Record<string, unknown> = {};
  content: string = "";

  // Parse a CommonMark or Markdown document into content and front matter
  parse(text: string) {
    const frontMatterRegex: RegExp = /^---([\s\S]+?)---/;
    const match: Array<string> | null = text.match(frontMatterRegex) as Array<
      string
    >;

    if (match) {
      this.frontMatter = yaml.parse(match[1]) as Record<string, unknown>;
      this.content = text.slice(match[0].length).trim();
    } else {
      this.frontMatter = {};
      this.content = text;
    }
  }

  // Return this object as a CommonMark document with front matter and content.
  stringify(): string {
    if (Object.keys(this.frontMatter).length > 0) {
      return `---
${yaml.stringify(this.frontMatter)}---

${this.content}`;
    }
    return this.content;
  }
}


~~~

This object makes it easy to work the front matter and the main content parts of a CommonMark document. The `parse` and `stringify` methods can bookend the `process` method implementing the transform sequence. This provides the functionality needed to implement a CommonMark Processor.

The `process` method will evolve overtime. I need to minimize its complexity. The `process` method is only responsible for sequencing the transforms defined in their own modules.

## Inclusion mechanisms

Before writing the `process` method I will work through the transform modules.

I need two inclusion mechanisms. One will support plain text file inclusion. The other will wrap the included file in the CommonMark markup for code blocks. Here's the syntax I want to use in my CommonMark document.

> `@include-text-block` `FILENAME`

> `@include-code-block` `FILENAME LANGUAGE`

Each of these will be implemented in their own module. Let's look at the one for `@include-text-block`. Here's what the include text module looks like.

~~~TypeScript
/**
 * includeTextBlock takes a text string and replaces the code blocks
 * based on the file path included in the line and the langauge name
 * The generate code block uses the `~~~` sequence to delimit the block
 * with the language name provided in the opening delimiter.
 *
 * @param text:string to be transformed
 * @returns the transformed text as a string
 */
export function includeTextBlock(text: string): string {
  // Find the include-text-block directive in the page.
  const insertBlockRegExp:RegExp = /@include-text-block\s+([^\s]+)(?:\s+(\w+))?/g;

  // Insert the code blocks
  return text.replace(insertBlockRegExp, replaceTextBlock);
}

// replaceTextBlock does that actual replacement work with the result
// of the matched RegExp.
function replaceTextBlock(_fullMatch: string, filePath:string):string {
  let fileContent:string = '';
  try {
    fileContent = Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error inserting block from ${filePath}, ${error}`);
  }
  if (fileContent) {
    return fileContent;
  } else {
    return `@include-text-block ${filePath}`;
  }
}

~~~

The public function handles finding the file referenced, reading it into a string before including it the transformed content block.  Let's look at the one for `@include-code-block`.

/**

export function includeCodeBlock(text: string):string {

  // Insert the code blocks
  return text.replace(insertBlockRegExp, replaceCodeBlock);
}

// replaceCodeBlock does that actual replacement work with the result
// of the matched RegExp.
function replaceCodeBlock(_fullMatch:string, filePath: string, language:string = ""): string {
  const fileContent:string = Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
  if (fileContent) {
    return "~~~" + language + "\n" + fileContent + "\n~~~";
  } else {
    console.error(`Error inserting block from ${filePath}`);
    return `@include-code-block ${filePath} ${language}`;
  }
}

~~~

These modules are very similar. I've implemented them as separate modules because I want the option of evolving them independently. I don't want to entangled the two functions unnecessarily. Keeping both simple in separate modules aligns with that.

## Hashtags and Mentions

The other transforms needed in the `process` method are extracting the Hashtags and Mentions which will be used to update the front matter. Both Hashtags and Mentions are similar. They have a prefix, "#" or "@" followed by a sequence of alphanumeric characters, period and underscores. Trailing periods are stripped. They should be kept separate in the front matter. Each plays different content roles. 

Collecting  tags in the text is easy using a regular expression. I have to make a choice about the resulting list. One approach would just be list a tag each time it is encountered. This will result in repeated tags. That can be problematic. Instead I would like the list of tags returned to be a unique list. The extraction function will need a parameter for the source text and the prefix. It should return a list of unique tags. I'm going to call this function, `extractTags`.

As I collect tags I will need an ability to merge the unique tag. That suggestions a merge function. That function will take one or more lists of tags and return a single list of unique tags.  I'm going to call these function `mergeTags`. Both relate to tags and exist because of extraction.  I'll put them in a module called `extractTags.ts`.  Here is my implementation.

~~~TypeScript
// Extract tags. By default it extracts HashTags. You may provide
// another prefix like '@' to extract @Tags.
export function extractTags(text: string, prefix: string = "#"): string[] {
  // Regular expression to match tags based on the prefix, including alphanumeric,
  // periods, and underscores.
  const regex = new RegExp(`${prefix}[\\w.]+`, "g");
  //const regex = new RegExp(`${prefix}[\\w.]+?(?=\\s|$|[^\\w.])`, 'g');
  const tags = text.match(regex);
  if (tags === null) {
    return [];
  }
  // Further process the tags to remove any trailing periods
  return tags.map((tag) => tag.replace(/\.$/, ""));
}

// mergeTags takes a list of tag lists and merges them
// into a single list of unique tags.
export function mergeTags(...tagLists: string[][]): string[] {
  // Use a Set to automatically handle uniqueness
  const uniqueTags = new Set<string>();

  // Iterate over each list of tags
  tagLists.forEach((tagList) => {
    // Add each tag to the Set
    tagList.forEach((tag) => uniqueTags.add(tag));
  });

  // Convert the Set back to an array and return it
  return Array.from(uniqueTags);
}

~~~

## The `process` method

I have the set of transforms I want. I will need to sequence them in the `process` method.  Here is a look at the internals of the `process` method.

~~~TypeScript

// Process uses the existing CommonMark object to create a new one transforming the front matter
// and content accordingly. E.g. handling HashTags, @Tags, `@include-code-block`.
//
// NOTE: This function uses a synchonous read to include content for code blocks. If have a slow disk
// access or lots of included code blocks this will raise the execution time of this method.
//
// If a code block can't be read it will leave the `@include-code-block` text in place.
process() {
  // Clone a copy of this object.
  const cmark: CommonMarkDoc = new Object(this) as CommonMarkDoc;

  // Handle included text blocks
  cmark.content = includeTextBlock(cmark.content);

  // Extract any HashTags from content
  const hashTags: string[] = extractTags(cmark.content, "#");
  const atTags: string[] = extractTags(cmark.content, "@");

  // Process our HashTags adding them to our keywords list
  if (
    cmark.frontMatter.hashTags === undefined ||
    cmark.frontMatter.hashTags === null
  ) {
    cmark.frontMatter.hashTags = [];
  }
  cmark.frontMatter.hashTags = mergeTags(cmark.frontMatter.hashTags as string[], hashTags);

  // Process our @Tags and add them to an AtTag list.
  if (
    cmark.frontMatter.atTags === undefined ||
    cmark.frontMatter.atTags === null
  ) {
    cmark.frontMatter.atTags = [];
  }
  cmark.frontMatter.atTags = mergeTags(cmark.frontMatter.atTags as string[], atTags);

  // Handle include code blocks
  cmark.content = includeCodeBlock(cmark.content);

  // We can now return the revised object.
  return cmark;
}

~~~

To use the the transform functions in the `process` method I need to import them.

~~~TypeScript

import { extractTags, mergeTags } from "./extractTags.ts";
import { includeCodeBlock } from "./includeCodeBlock.ts";
import { includeTextBlock } from "./includeTextBlock.ts";


~~~

## The complete CommonMark processor module

Here is the complete `commonMarkDoc.ts` module.

~~~TypeScript
import * as yaml from "@std/yaml";

import { extractTags, mergeTags } from "./extractTags.ts";
import { includeCodeBlock } from "./includeCodeBlock.ts";
import { includeTextBlock } from "./includeTextBlock.ts";

export class CommonMarkDoc {
  frontMatter: Record<string, unknown> = {};
  content: string = "";

  // Parse a CommonMark or Markdown document into content and front matter
  parse(text: string) {
    const frontMatterRegex: RegExp = /^---([\s\S]+?)---/;
    const match: Array<string> | null = text.match(frontMatterRegex) as Array<
      string
    >;

    if (match) {
      this.frontMatter = yaml.parse(match[1]) as Record<string, unknown>;
      this.content = text.slice(match[0].length).trim();
    } else {
      this.frontMatter = {};
      this.content = text;
    }
  }

  // Return this object as a CommonMark document with front matter and content.
  stringify(): string {
    if (Object.keys(this.frontMatter).length > 0) {
      return `---
${yaml.stringify(this.frontMatter)}---

${this.content}`;
    }
    return this.content;
  }

  // Process uses the existing CommonMark object to create a new one transforming the front matter
  // and content accordingly. E.g. handling HashTags, @Tags, `@include-code-block`.
  //
  // NOTE: This function uses a synchonous read to include content for code blocks. If have a slow disk
  // access or lots of included code blocks this will raise the execution time of this method.
  //
  // If a code block can't be read it will leave the `@include-code-block` text in place.
  process() {
    // Clone a copy of this object.
    const cmark: CommonMarkDoc = new Object(this) as CommonMarkDoc;

    // Handle included text blocks
    cmark.content = includeTextBlock(cmark.content);

    // Extract any HashTags from content
    const hashTags: string[] = extractTags(cmark.content, "#");
    const atTags: string[] = extractTags(cmark.content, "@");

    // Process our HashTags adding them to our keywords list
    if (
      cmark.frontMatter.hashTags === undefined ||
      cmark.frontMatter.hashTags === null
    ) {
      cmark.frontMatter.hashTags = [];
    }
    cmark.frontMatter.hashTags = mergeTags(cmark.frontMatter.hashTags as string[], hashTags);

    // Process our @Tags and add them to an AtTag list.
    if (
      cmark.frontMatter.atTags === undefined ||
      cmark.frontMatter.atTags === null
    ) {
      cmark.frontMatter.atTags = [];
    }
    cmark.frontMatter.atTags = mergeTags(cmark.frontMatter.atTags as string[], atTags);

    // Handle include code blocks
    cmark.content = includeCodeBlock(cmark.content);

    // We can now return the revised object.
    return cmark;
  }
}

## The CommonMark processor application

To use this module I need to wrap it so I can execute it from the command line. My processor is going to be called `cmarkprocess` so I'll name the module that becomes the command line program is `cmarkprocess.ts`. This module will include a "main" function, that function will handle command line options and parameters as well as read data from either standard input or a file.  It'll use the `CommonMarkDoc` `process` method and write the results to standard out.

~~~TypeScript
import * as yaml from "@std/yaml";
import { parse as parseArgs } from "@std/flags";

import { CommonMarkDoc } from "./commonMarkDoc.ts";

// main implements a light weight CommonMark processor
// called `cmarkprocess`. It demonstrates the features of the
// CommonMarkDoc module.
async function main() {
  const appName = "cmarkprocess";
  const args = parseArgs(Deno.args, {
    boolean: ["help", "version", "license"],
    alias: {
      h: "help",
      v: "version",
      l: "license",
    },
  });
  const version:string = '1';
  const licenseText: string = `${appName} is a program to process CommonMark documents with front matter.

# SYNOPSIS

${appName} [COMMONMARK_FILENAME]

# DESCRIPTION

This is a CommonMark processor that can read a CommonMark text
transforming it into an update CommonMark text base on the following
features.

- support for HashTags and Mentions, merging them into the document's
  front matter
- \`@include-text-block\` allows for text includes
  - Example: \`@include-text-black\` \`FILENAME\`
- \`@include-code-block\` allows for including code blocks
  - Example: \`@include-code-black\` \`FILENAME [LANGUAGE]\`

# OPTION

`);
    Deno.exit(0);
  }

  if (args.version) {
    console.log(`${appName} ${version}`);
    Deno.exit(0);
  }

  if (args.license) {
    console.log(licenseText);
    Deno.exit(0);
  }

  const cmark = new CommonMarkDoc();
  const filePath = args._[0] as string;
  let text: string = "";
  if (args._.length === 0) {
    const decoder = new TextDecoder();
    for await (const chunk of Deno.stdin.readable) {
      text += decoder.decode(chunk);
    }
  } else {
    text = await Deno.readTextFile(filePath);
  }
  cmark.parse(text);
  try {
    await cmark.process();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`ERROR (${filePath}): ${error}`);
    Deno.exit(1);
  }
  const output = cmark.stringify();
  console.log(output);
}

if (import.meta.main) {
  await main();
}

~~~

Now that we have our wrapping modules, how do I get a nice executable using Deno?

~~~shell
deno compile --allow-read -o bin/cmarkprocess cmarkprocess.ts
~~~

The result is an executable, `bin/cmarkprocess`. This executable can read from standard input or from a file path. It will write to standard output.
