      <h1>Building a CommonMark Processor in Deno+TypeScript</h1>
      <p>By R. S. Doiel, 2025-07-26</p>
      <p>CommonMark and Markdown are easier to proof read and edit than HTML. CommonMark is a super set of John Grubber's original Markdown. It incorporates common practices and extensions to the original Markdown. I've found over the years the &quot;Markdown&quot; I type is really &quot;CommonMark&quot;. I use <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> for processing my CommonMark documents into HTML. There are a few transforms I'd like to make before I send the text off to Pandoc. That is what I'll be covering.</p>
      <p>My CommonMark Processor will be responsible for several things. The features I miss are simple. Here's the short list.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>support <code>@include-code-block</code> for including code samples as code blocks</li>
      <li>support <code>@include-text-block</code> for include plain text into a CommonMark document</li>
      <li>transform Hashtags into front matter</li>
      <li>transform web Mentions into front matter</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My homepage is built from a sequence of plain text files.
      I also commonly need to include source code in my blog posts.  That has lead me to think about an include mechanisms. A source file should be included in a CommonMark code block while plain text can be included as is.</p>
      <p>The include blocks, text and code, can also be detected through regular expression. The difference for those is they require reading files from disk. That needs to be handled.</p>
      <p>Here's the syntax I'd use for code block and included texts.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><code>@include-code-block</code> <code>FILEPATH [LANGUAGE]</code></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p><code>@include-text-block</code> <code>FILEPATH</code></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Finally I'd to add support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag">Hashtags</a> and web <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mention_(blogging)">Mentions</a>. I want to explore integrating both with facets in search results, for that I'll need to track them in the front matter. Overtime I'll explore new features. The <code>commonMarkDoc.ts</code> module needs to be simple to extend.</p>
      <p>How do I extract Hashtags and Mentions? Both are function similar though are used for different purposes. A regular expression should be suitable to pick them out. The difference between extracting a Hashtag or a Mention is the prefix, &quot;#&quot; or &quot;@&quot;. A function that code use the supplied text and prefix could return a list of tagged results.</p>
      <p>I want to easily extend the processor. I can create modules based on the transforms I need. Each module will include a function that implements the transform. The <code>process</code> method will be responsible for sequencing the transforms and updating the CommonMark object with the results.</p>
      <p>What do I need in my CommonMark document object? I need to take the markup, parse it and have the object holding the CommonMark document split into front matter and content. Similarly I will need to reassemble the parts into back into a CommonMark text.  Those functions will be called <code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code>. These names are idiomatic in JavaScript and TypeScript. The object type will be called <code>CommonMarkDoc</code>.</p>
      <p>Here is the basic outline of the <code>CommonMarkDoc</code> object without the <code>process</code> method.</p>

      </code></pre>
      <p>This object makes it easy to work the front matter and the main content parts of a CommonMark document. The <code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code> methods can bookend the <code>process</code> method implementing the transform sequence. This provides the functionality needed to implement a CommonMark Processor.</p>
      <p>The <code>process</code> method will evolve overtime. I need to minimize its complexity. The <code>process</code> method is only responsible for sequencing the transforms defined in their own modules.</p>
      <h2>Inclusion mechanisms</h2>
      <p>Before writing the <code>process</code> method I will work through the transform modules.</p>
      <p>I need two inclusion mechanisms. One will support plain text file inclusion. The other will wrap the included file in the CommonMark markup for code blocks. Here's the syntax I want to use in my CommonMark document.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><code>@include-text-block</code> <code>FILENAME</code></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p><code>@include-code-block</code> <code>FILENAME LANGUAGE</code></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Each of these will be implemented in their own module. Let's look at the one for <code>@include-text-block</code>. Here's what the include text module looks like.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-TypeScript">/**
       * includeTextBlock takes a text string and replaces the code blocks
       * based on the file path included in the line and the langauge name
       * The generate code block uses the `~~~` sequence to delimit the block
       * with the language name provided in the opening delimiter.

        // Insert the code blocks
        return text.replace(insertBlockRegExp, replaceTextBlock);
      }
      
      // replaceTextBlock does that actual replacement work with the result
      // of the matched RegExp.
      function replaceTextBlock(_fullMatch: string, filePath:string):string {
        let fileContent:string = '';
        try {
          fileContent = Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(`Error inserting block from ${filePath}, ${error}`);

      </code></pre>
      <p>These modules are very similar. I've implemented them as separate modules because I want the option of evolving them independently. I don't want to entangled the two functions unnecessarily. Keeping both simple in separate modules aligns with that.</p>
      <h2>Hashtags and Mentions</h2>
      <p>The other transforms needed in the <code>process</code> method are extracting the Hashtags and Mentions which will be used to update the front matter. Both Hashtags and Mentions are similar. They have a prefix, &quot;#&quot; or &quot;@&quot; followed by a sequence of alphanumeric characters, period and underscores. Trailing periods are stripped. They should be kept separate in the front matter. Each plays different content roles.</p>
      <p>Collecting  tags in the text is easy using a regular expression. I have to make a choice about the resulting list. One approach would just be list a tag each time it is encountered. This will result in repeated tags. That can be problematic. Instead I would like the list of tags returned to be a unique list. The extraction function will need a parameter for the source text and the prefix. It should return a list of unique tags. I'm going to call this function, <code>extractTags</code>.</p>
      <p>As I collect tags I will need an ability to merge the unique tag. That suggestions a merge function. That function will take one or more lists of tags and return a single list of unique tags.  I'm going to call these function <code>mergeTags</code>. Both relate to tags and exist because of extraction.  I'll put them in a module called <code>extractTags.ts</code>.  Here is my implementation.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-TypeScript">// Extract tags. By default it extracts HashTags. You may provide
      // another prefix like '@' to extract @Tags.
      export function extractTags(text: string, prefix: string = &quot;#&quot;): string[] {
        // Regular expression to match tags based on the prefix, including alphanumeric,
        // periods, and underscores.
        const regex = new RegExp(`${prefix}[\\w.]+`, &quot;g&quot;);
        //const regex = new RegExp(`${prefix}[\\w.]+?(?=\\s|$|[^\\w.])`, 'g');
        const tags = text.match(regex);
        if (tags === null) {
          return [];
        }
        // Further process the tags to remove any trailing periods
        return tags.map((tag) =&gt; tag.replace(/\.$/, &quot;&quot;));
      }
      
      // mergeTags takes a list of tag lists and merges them
      // into a single list of unique tags.
      export function mergeTags(...tagLists: string[][]): string[] {
        // Use a Set to automatically handle uniqueness
        const uniqueTags = new Set&lt;string&gt;();
      
        // Iterate over each list of tags
        tagLists.forEach((tagList) =&gt; {
          // Add each tag to the Set
          tagList.forEach((tag) =&gt; uniqueTags.add(tag));
        });
      
        // Convert the Set back to an array and return it
        return Array.from(uniqueTags);
      }

      <h2>The CommonMark processor application</h2>
      <p>To use this module I need to wrap it so I can execute it from the command line. My processor is going to be called <code>cmarkprocess</code> so I'll name the module that becomes the command line program is <code>cmarkprocess.ts</code>. This module will include a &quot;main&quot; function, that function will handle command line options and parameters as well as read data from either standard input or a file.  It'll use the <code>CommonMarkDoc</code> <code>process</code> method and write the results to standard out.</p>

      # SYNOPSIS
      
      ${appName} [COMMONMARK_FILENAME]
      
      # DESCRIPTION
      
      This is a CommonMark processor that can read a CommonMark text
      transforming it into an update CommonMark text base on the following
      features.
      
      - support for HashTags and Mentions, merging them into the document's
        front matter
      - \`@include-text-block\` allows for text includes
        - Example: \`@include-text-black\` \`FILENAME\`
      - \`@include-code-block\` allows for including code blocks
        - Example: \`@include-code-black\` \`FILENAME [LANGUAGE]\`

      <p>Now that we have our wrapping modules, how do I get a nice executable using Deno?</p>
      <pre><code class="language-shell">deno compile --allow-read -o bin/cmarkprocess cmarkprocess.ts
      </code></pre>
      <p>The result is an executable, <code>bin/cmarkprocess</code>. This executable can read from standard input or from a file path. It will write to standard output.</p>
