# Thoughts on signed binaries and business models

## Why no Apple signed binaries?

To sign the binaries I would need to be an "Apple Developer". To be an "Apple Developer", I or someone on his behalf would need to pay an annual fee. I, Robert, thinks this is ridiculous. Why do you need to pay someone to write software for hardware that was already paid for? It feels like being extorted for your lunch money. Robert is stubborn and refuses to be an Apple Developer. Robert writes Open Source software so anyone can compile should they choose including Apple employees. He does not extort lunch money from them.

Apple's insistence on requiring payment is a little rich. Apple's operating systems, macOS and iOS, are derived from Open Source software. Apple's current operating systems are derived form the Mach kernel and BSD. The developer tools are derived from Clang, another open source software ecosystem. The software I write is also open source. There's a trend somewhere on that path.

## Why no signed binaries for other companies?

When I considered Apple's policies, I rejected the fee to write software. When Microsoft, Google, et el. followed a similar path my eye brows raised in extreme skepticism. I am concerned for my eye brows. My perception is this is less about actual security and more about business models. Security is being used as an excuse to enable vendor lock in or drive people to rent software from the "cloud". This seems incredibly silly to me. I am a stubborn person. I am going along with this practice. I apologizes for the inconvenience but insist I avoid feeling a part of a lunch money extortion plot. I feel I should be free to practice my vocation of writing open source software without being required to participate in business models that neither benefit my employer, my community or myself.

## What are your options to use the software?

There are ways to allow the operating system to run the software. You can follow the instructions complete with the scary warnings to do so. You can also download the source code and build the software yourself. It is open source software after all.
