<h1 id="thoughts-on-signed-binaries-and-business-models">Thoughts on
signed binaries and business models</h1>
<h2 id="why-no-apple-signed-binaries">Why no Apple signed binaries?</h2>
<p>To sign the binaries Robert Doiel would need to be an “Apple
Developer”. To be an “Apple Developer”, Robert or someone on his behalf
would need to pay an annual fee. Robert thinks this is ridiculous. Why
do you need to pay someone to write software for hardware that was
already paid for? It feels like being extorted for your lunch money.
Robert is stubborn and refuses to be an Apple Developer. Robert writes
Open Source software so anyone can compile should they choose including
Apple employees. He does not extort lunch money from them.</p>
<p>Apple’s insistence on requiring payment is a little rich. Apple’s
operating systems, macOS and iOS, are derived from Open Source software.
Apple’s current operating systems are derived form the Mach kernel and
BSD. The developer tools are derived from Clang, another open source
software ecosystem. The software I write is also open source. There’s a
trend somewhere on that path.</p>
<h2 id="why-no-signed-binaries-for-other-companies">Why no signed
binaries for other companies?</h2>
<p>When Robert considered Apple’s policies and he rejected the fee to
write software. When Microsoft, Google, et el. followed a similar path
Robert’s eye brows raised in extreme skepticism. Robert was concerned
for his eye brows. Robert’s perception is this is less about actual
security and more about business models and the potential to enable
vendor lock in. This seems incredibly silly to Robert. Robert is
stubborn person. Robert isn’t going along with this practice. Robert
apologizes for the inconvenience but insist he doesn’t like the feeling
of being extorted for lunch money. Robert feels he should be free to
practice his vocation of writing open source software without being
required to participate in business models that neither benefit his
employer, community or himself.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-your-options-to-use-the-software">What are your options
to use the software?</h2>
<p>There are ways to allow the operating system to run the software. You
can follow the instructions complete with the scary warnings to do so.
You can also download the source code and build the software yourself.
It is open source software after all.</p>
<h1 id="about-this-document">ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT</h1>
<p>These are Robert Doiel opinions. Robert’s opinions do not reflect his
employer’s policies, procedures or practices.</p>
