<h1 id="thoughts-on-signed-binaries-and-business-models">Thoughts on
signed binaries and business models</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2025-07-24</p>
<h2 id="why-no-apple-signed-binaries">Why no Apple signed binaries?</h2>
<p>To sign the binaries I would need to be an “Apple Developer”. To be
an “Apple Developer”, I or someone on my behalf would need to pay an
annual fee. I thinks this is ridiculous. Why do you need to pay someone
to write software for hardware that was already paid for? It feels like
being extorted for your lunch money. I am stubborn and refuse to be an
Apple Developer. I write Open Source software so anyone can compile and
run it. Should they choose this includes Apple employees. I do not
extort lunch money.</p>
<p>Apple’s insistence on requiring payment is a little rich. Apple’s
operating systems, macOS and iOS, are derived from Open Source software.
Apple’s current operating systems are derived from the Mach kernel and
BSD. The developer tools are derived from Clang. Another open source
software project. The software I write is also open source. There’s a
trend here.</p>
<h2 id="why-no-signed-binaries-for-other-companies">Why no signed
binaries for other companies?</h2>
<p>When I considered Apple’s policies, I rejected the fee to write
software. When Microsoft, Google, et el. followed a similar path my eye
brows raised in extreme skepticism. I am concerned for my eye brows.</p>
<p>I believe this requirement is less about actual security and more
about business models. After all signing could be done in an open,
secure and distributed manner. It’s as easy as using a standard form of
public signing (e.g. PGP, SSH keys), having the OS supported the signed
binaries and hosting the public keys of the signed document a location
controlled by the individual or organization signing the executable. A
distributed approach does not require corporate sponsorship,
implementation or blessings. You could even implement a signing
mechanism similar to Let’s Encrypt used for HTTPS certificates.</p>
<p>Security is being used as an excuse to enable vendor lock in or drive
people to rent software from the “cloud”. This seems incredibly silly to
me. I am a stubborn person. I am <strong>NOT</strong> going along with
this practice. I apologize for the inconvenience but insist I avoid
feeling a part of a lunch money extortion plot. I feel I should be free
to practice my vocation of writing open source software without being
required to participate in business models that neither benefit my
employer, my community or myself.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-your-options-to-use-the-software">What are your options
to use the software?</h2>
<p>There are ways to allow the operating system to run the software. You
can follow the instructions complete with the scary warnings to do so.
You can also download the source code and build the software yourself.
It is open source software after all.</p>

<p>These are my opinions. My opinions do not reflect my employer’s
