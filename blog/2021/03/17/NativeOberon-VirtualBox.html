<h1 id="eth-oberon-system-3-on-virtualbox-6.1">ETH Oberon System 3 on
VirtualBox 6.1</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2021-03-17</p>
<p>In this post I am walking through installing Native Oberon 2.3.7 (aka
ETH Oberon System 3) on a virtual machine running under VirtualBox 6.1.
It is a follow up to my 2019 post <a
href="/blog/2019/07/28/freedos-to-oberon-system-3.html"
title="Link to old blog post for bringing up Oberon System 3 in VirtualBox 6.0 using FreeDOS 1.2">FreeDOS
to Oberon System 3</a>. To facilitate the install I will first prepare
my virtual machine as a FreeDOS 1.2 box. This simplifies getting the
virtual machines’ hard disk partitioned and formatted correctly. When
Native Oberon was released back in 1990’s most Intel flavored machines
shipped with some sort Microsoft OS on them. I believe that is why the
tools and instructions for Native Oberon assume you’re installing over
or along side a DOS partition.</p>
<h2 id="building-our-machine">Building our machine</h2>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install VirtualBox 6.1 installed on your host computer.</li>
<li>Download and install a minimal FreeDOS 1.2 as a virtual machine</li>
<li>Downloaded a copy of Native Oberon 2.3.7 alpha from SourceForge</li>
<li>Familiarized yourself Oberon’s Text User Interface</li>
<li>Boot your FreeDOS virtual machine using the Oberon0.Dsk downloaded
as part of NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz</li>
<li>Mount “Oberon0.Dsk” and start installing Native Oberon</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you boot “Oberon0.Dsk” on your virtual machine make sure
you’ve looked at some online Oberon documentation. This is important.
Oberon is very different from macOS, Windows, Linux, DOS, CP/M or Unix.
It is easy to read the instructions and miss important details like how
you use the three button mouse, particularly the selections and execute
actions of text instructions.</p>
<h2 id="virtual-machine-setup">Virtual Machine Setup</h2>
<p>VirtualBox 6.1 can be obtained from <a
href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">virtualbox.org</a>. This involves
downloading the installer for your particular host operating system
(e.g. Linux, macOS or Windows) and follow the instructions on the
VirtualBox website to complete the installation.</p>
<p>Once VirtualBox is installed, launch VirtualBox.</p>
<p>Click the “New” button and name your machine (e.g. “Native Oberon
2.3.7 Alpha”) and choose type of “Other” and version “DOS”. Click
continue. I accepted the default memory size of 32 MB. This is plenty
for Oberon. I clicked on create disk and accepted the default VDI
(VirtualBox Disk Image). Press continue. I think accepted “Dynamically
allocated”, press continue. I chose a “disk size” of 100.00 MB. Oberon
System is tiny. Press create button.</p>
<p>Make sure your new machine is highlight on the left side of the
VirtualBox management panel. Click on Settings button, it looks like a
gear towards the top. Click “Display” on the model dialog and bump the
Video Memory up to 128 MB. I also clicked Enable 3D Acceleration (though
I don’t think Oberon uses this). Before clicking OK click on the Network
icon in the modal dialog box. Change “NAT” to “Bridged Adapter”. Now
click “OK” to close the modal dialog box.</p>
<p>Your VirtualBox is now ready, before pressing “Start” we need to
install FreeDOS 1.2.</p>
<h2 id="make-a-freedos-1.2-machine">Make a FreeDOS 1.2 machine</h2>
<p>Download the <a
href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.2/FD12CD.iso">FD12CD.iso</a>
file from the <a href="https://freedos.org/download">FreeDOS
project</a>.</p>
<p>“Insert” the “FD12CD.ISO” file into our VirtualBox 6.1 CD-ROM drive.
Go to the VirtualBox management panel. In the area that summarizes
storage click the word “Empty” in the line with “[Optical Drive]”. Find
the “FD12CD.ISO” you downloaded and select it.</p>
<p>Now press the green “Start” arrow in the VirtualBox management panel.
This should start your virtual machine and it will boot using the CD-ROM
drive.</p>
<p>This will display a welcome screen with installation options. Press
your “tab” key once. This should cause a boot string to be displayed.
Type a space and then type the word “raw” (without quotes). Press enter.
Next select the language you want to install with (e.g. English). Choose
“Yes - Continue with installation” on the next prompt. You should then
be given a dialog box that indicates “Drive C: does not appear to be
partitioned.”, select “Yes - Partition drive C:”. Then that completes
press “Yes - Please reboot now”.</p>
<p>This will cause the machine to reboot and you will be faced with the
“Welcome to FreeDOS 1.2” screen once again. Press the “tab” Add a space
and type “raw” to the boot string as before. Select the language again
then select “Yes - Continue with installation”. The screen should now
say something like “Drive C: does not appear to be formatted”, select
“Yes - Please erase and format drive C:”.</p>
<p>When done it’ll gather some info on the system and ask you which
keyboard you’re using. Pick yours (e.g. “US English (Default)”). It will
then give you a choice of what to install. Since we’re going to
overwrite this when we install Oberon just select the base package, then
select “Yes - Please install FreeDOS 1.2”</p>
<p>Before selecting “Yes - Please reboot now” when the install is
finished you want to “eject” your FD12CD.ISO from the virtual CD-ROM
drive. Switch back to your VirtualBox management panel. Click the text
that says “FD12CD.iso” and select “remove disk from virtual drive” in
the popup menu. Switch back to your Virtual machine and select “Yes -
Please reboot now”</p>
<p>If all goes well the machine will boot into FreeDOS 1.2. When you see
the “C:&gt;” prompt type “shutdown” (without the quotes) and press
enter. We’re now ready to start installing Native Oberon 2.3.7.</p>
<h2 id="native-oberon-2.3.7">Native Oberon 2.3.7</h2>
<p>Native Oberon used to be hosted at ETH where Oberon and the Oberon
System was first developed as a research and instructional project.
Unfortunately this seems to no longer be supported by ETH. Prof. Wirth
has long been retired now and they no longer choose to use such a useful
language or Operating System.</p>
<p>SourceForge has a mirror of the original sources and some of the
remaining community has put at a “new” release of 2.3.7 Alpha bringing
Native Oberon a little closer to the present. It’s this version we’ll
use. You can read more at the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/">SourceForge</a> as
well as at the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Oberon">Oberon
Wikibook</a>. ETH also still maintains an email list for Oberon and it
is active. It can be found at
https://lists.inf.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/oberon. I recommend browsing
the archives of the Email list if you run into problems. I’ve found very
helpful information there and the people on the list seem happy to
answer a novices question.</p>
<p>We are going to be downloading files from the Native Oberon Project’s
Files page at SourceForge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/files/nativeoberon/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Files page download the instructions <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/files/NativeOberonInstall.pdf/download">NativeOberonInstall.pdf</a>
or or the text version. This document by Pieter Muller (May 1999)
explains the installation process. It is good for its overview though I
found the actual process simpler than what was described for May
1999.</p>
<p>On the Files page you’ll also see a green button to “Download Latest
Version”, NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz. Click the button and download
it.</p>
<p>The NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz contains the files we’ll need to run
NativeOberon on our VirtualBox. Ungzip and untar the file into a
location that is convenient for you. I put mine in
<code>src/NativeOberon-2.3.7</code> and I had downloaded the file into
my home directory’s “Downloads” folder.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    mkdir -p src/NativeOberon-2.3.7
    cd src/NativeObeorn-2.3.7
    tar zxvf ~/Downloads/NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p>You now have the software ready to proceed in installing the system
in VirtualBox.</p>
<h2 id="nativeoberon-in-a-virtualbox">NativeOberon in a VirtualBox</h2>
<p>Go back to your VirtualBox management panel. We need to place he boot
disk image in the virtual floppy drive. In the files we unpacked
(i.e. ungzip and untar) there is a file named “Oberon0.Dsk”. We want to
mount that in the virtual floppy drive. Click on the word “Empty” next
to “Floppy Device 0:” in the management panel. You are then given a
modal dialog box and we want to select “Choose a disk file”. You can
then find the files you save and select “Oberon0.Dsk”.</p>
<h2 id="booting-with-oberon0.dsk">Booting with Oberon0.Dsk</h2>
<p>We can now click “Start” button at the top of the VirtualBox
management panel. This will boot the virtual machine using
“Oberon0.Dsk”. Oberon itself loads completely into memory.</p>
<p>You now have a running Oberon System but we need to install it on the
virtual hard drive. Fortunately our running system comes with built in
instructions. It is here that people how haven’t used Oberon before are
going to run into trouble.</p>
<p>Oberon System uses all three buttons of a three button mouse. On most
mice I’ve encountered to day there are two buttons and a scroll wheel.
The scroll wheel is click able and functions like the middle button on
an Oberon mouse.</p>
<p>The left mount button sets the pointer, the middle button (our scroll
wheel if your mouse is like mine) is used to execute commands and the
right mouse button is used to select text. In our installation
instructions displayed on our virtual machine we generally be middle
clicking the blue colored text.</p>
<p>In Native Oberon all text is potentially actionable. Unlike in Unix
where you type a command press enter then have to retype (or use the
command history) to execute the next command we’re going to click on the
text and sometimes select text to execute commands. Before we proceed I
highly recommend readying and trying a tutorial out before attempting to
install Oberon on your virtual hard drive. There is an <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171226183816/http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/ethoberon/tutorial/">Oberon
System 3 - Main Tutorial</a> available at the Internet Archive’s Wayback
machine.</p>
<h2 id="installing-to-our-virtual-hard-disk">Installing to our Virtual
Hard disk</h2>
<p>Along the right side (in the system track) is the text “Edit.Open
Introduction.Text”. Click with your middle button (scroll wheel on my
mouse) and this will open the text in the “Edit” track on the left side.
Read this text if you haven’t before. Scrolling through the text is a
little different than the scroll bars on macOS, Windows, X Windows. They
are on the left side and the middle mouse button sets the scroll
position. The left button pages down, the right pages up. You can close
the “Introduction.Text” windows by middle clicking “System.Close” in the
upper menu bar.</p>
<h2 id="review-step-1.">Review step 1.</h2>
<p>We need to configure the hard drive by middle clicking on
“Config.Desk Standard ATA/EIDE”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. In the console viewer
above you should see something like</p>
<pre><code>Disk: Standard ATA/EIDE
Static BootLinker for OM Object Files / prk
 linking Native.Bin 255388</code></pre>
<h2 id="review-step-2.">Review step 2.</h2>
<p>Middle click on “Edit.Open InstallFiles.Tool”. A “Tool” file is like
a text file but usually contains instructions and a sorta menu or recipe
of commands. In fact our instructions in the lower viewer of the system
track is a “Tool” file called “Install.Tool”. Using “Edit.Open” to open
the tool or text file opens a viewer on the left track, the edit track.
If you had clicked on “System.Open Install.Tool” it would open a viewer
on the right, or systems track. In either track by default the viewers
will tile (not overlap). If you want to close a view you can click on
“System.Close” in the viewer’s menu bar. Now open our InstallFiles.Tool
in the edit track.</p>
<h2 id="installfiles.tool">InstallFiles.Tool</h2>
<p>We now are going to prepare our virtual hard drive. Like our
“Install.Tool” text we have a series of instructions which commands we
can click on (the ones in blue).</p>
<p>Middle click on “Partitions.Show ~”. This will open a pain showing
the partition information. You should see something like</p>
<pre><code>Disk: Diskette0, GetSize: no media, removable

Disk: IDE0, 99MB, VBOX HARDDISK
IDE0#00        99MB  --- (Whole disk)
IDE0#01        99MB  --- (Free)

Disk: IDE2, GetSize: no media, removable, VBOX CD-ROM</code></pre>
<p>This tells us we have three drives in our VirtualBox visible to
Oberon. The first is the floppy drive. It shows “no media”. That might
seem odd but when you read the “Oberon0.Dsk” it read that into memory
and the whole OS is not running in memory, not from disk! While the disk
is still “in the drive” as far as VirtualBox is concerned it isn’t
“mounted” from the point of view of the operating system.</p>
<p>The second disk section describes our virtual hard drive. The third
describes the virtual CD-ROM drive.</p>
<p>We’re interested in using the disk “IDE0” with the device number of
“01”, we express that as “IDE0#01”.</p>
<p>In the “Partitions.Text” viewer where we see the partitions
information we can type the command described in “InstallFiles.Tool”</p>
<pre><code>Partitions.ChangeType IDE0#01 6 76 ~</code></pre>
<p>We then middle mouse click on line we just type. This should produce
output in the “System.Log” view in the upper right of the screen that
looks like</p>
<pre><code>IDE0#01 changed to type 76</code></pre>
<p>I had to do a modified version of step 3 of “InstallFiles.Tool”
choosing option “b”.</p>
<p>In the output of “Partitions.show ~” (i.e. the Partitions.Text
viewer) want to middle click on the “I” of “IDE0#01”. Then right mouse
button select “IDE0#01”.</p>
<p>From 3a in the “InstallFiles.Tool” viewer middle mouse button click
on “Partitions.Format ↑”. This should result in the “System.Log” viewer
showing</p>
<pre><code>IDE0#01 format successful</code></pre>
<p>After formatting the drive I was able to complete step 3b by middle
clicking the commands as provided in the “InstallFiles.Tool”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: you may need to scroll that window to see all of step 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Middle click on “Partitions.UpdateBootFile ↑” The “Systems.Log”
viewer should show</p>
<pre><code>IDE#00 update successful</code></pre>
<p>Middle click on “FilesSystem.Mount DST AosFS ↑” in 3b. The
“System.Log” viewer should show</p>
<pre><code>DST: mounted</code></pre>
<p>We are ready for Step 4. This command does the brunt of the work of
coping things over. The command “Configuration.DoCommands” take a list
of Oberon commands and executes them one after the other. Middle Mouse
click on “Configuration.DoCommands”. The “System.Log” viewer will show
many messages that are a result of each command taken. Make sure there
are no errors. The last series of commands renamed files so you should
see something like</p>
<pre><code>System.RenameFiles
DST:Rel.Obeorn.Text =&gt; DST:Oberon.Text renaming
DST:Rel.Network.Tool =&gt; DST:Network.Tool renaming
DST:Rel.DOS.Tool =&gt; DST:DOS.Tool renaming</code></pre>
<p>For step 5 of “InstallFiles.Tool” we can close our
“InstallFiles.Tool” viewer by middle clicking on “System.Close” in the
menu bar. You can also close the “Partitions.Text” viewer using its menu
bar and middle clicking “System.Close”.</p>
<p>Right now we’ve formatted our hard drive and copied a bunch of files
too it. We still need to configuration our system before it is self
hosting.</p>
<p>In the “Install.Tool” viewer we want to open our “Configure.Tool”.
Middle click on the “Edit.Open Configure.Tool”.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-our-oberon-system">Configuring our Oberon
System</h2>
<p>The configuration tool breaks configuration into a series of parts.
First part is configure the display in Part two we make the hard disk
bootable.</p>
<p>To configure out display we want to middle click on the blue text in
“Config.DetectVesa (BIOS cal might hang some systems!)”. You will be
presented with a list of screen resolutions. I middle clicked the blue
text in “Config.Vesa 00000147H 1600 * 1200 * 32”. In the “System.Log”
viewer this showed</p>
<pre><code>Vesa mode 00000147H</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: You will likely need to scroll down the page using the scroll
bar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In part two we need to decide how we want to boot Oberon. In our case
I recommend Option 2, boot Oberon directly (non-FAT hosted). Middle
click the blue text “Config.BootParition menu ~”. The “System.Log”
viewer should output</p>
<pre><code>IDE0#01 config written</code></pre>
<p>Middle click the blue text “Partitions.Show ~”. Like in
“InstallFiles.Tool” this will open a new “Partitions.Text” viewer with
content like</p>
<pre><code>Disk: Diskette0, GetSize: no media, removable

Disk: IDE0, 99MB, VBOX HARDDISK
IDE0#00       99MB  --- (Whole disk)
IDE0#01       99MB   76 * Native Oberon, Aos

Disk: IDE2, GetSize: no media, removable, VBOX CD-ROM</code></pre>
<p>Using your right mouse button select “IDE0#01” then in the
“Configure.Tool” viewer middle click the blue text “Partitions.Activate
↑”. The “System.Log” viewer should show</p>
<pre><code>IDE0#01 already active</code></pre>
<p>We don’t have a partition to deactivate so we can skip the last step
of option 2. This is a good place to “eject” our floppy disk
“Oberon0.Dsk” before we “System.Reboot”.</p>
<p>To eject the disk click on “Oberon0.Dsk” in the VirtualBox manager
panel. The should then change the text to “Empty”.</p>
<p>Finally we’re ready to move to the last step in “Configure.Tool”.
Scroll down and find “System.Reboot”. Middle click on the blue text
“System.Reboot”. At this point the virtualbox should reboot from the
virtual hard drive. This reboot will take a little longer than the
floppy boot and the screen size of the virtualbox will be large based on
the settings you picked early. You have a minimal working Oberon System
3. Now to install some more programs and flesh the system out.</p>
<h2 id="install-some-programs">Install some programs</h2>
<p>First we need to get the zip files provided in
NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz on to the hard drive.<br />
Historically these were done via 1.44 MB floppy disks. We’re going to
make it easier. Native Oberon 2.3.7 can read an ISO formatted
CD-ROM.</p>
<h2 id="making-our-virtual-cd-rom">Making our virtual CD-ROM</h2>
<p>Under Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS machine creating a ISO image is one command.
Below is I am going to create an ISO image of the directory
“NativeOberon-2.3.7” and save the image as “NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso”.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    mkisofs -J --iso-level 3 \
        -o NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso NativeOberon-2.3.7</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-J</code> says to use the Joliet extensions, the
<code>--iso-level</code> sets the level of ISO support, in this case to
3. See the manpage for <code>mkisofs</code> for details.</p>
<p>On macOS this involves two commands. First use the “Disk Utility” to
create an image of the folder where you unpacked
NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz. This will result in a “.dmg” or disk image
file common on macOS. Next we need to convert this to an ISO formatted
image file. For that we use a command line macOS tool called
<code>hdiutil</code> to convert the disk image to an ISO format. In the
process you will create the ISO file but it will have the extension of
“.cdr”. You can rename (i.e. mv) that file so it has a “.iso” extension.
This is suitable to mount in VirtualBox’s virtual CD-ROM drive.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    hdiutil convert NativeOberon-2.3.7.dmg -format UDTO -o NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso
    mv NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso.cdr NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso</code></pre>
<p>Go to the VirtualBox 6.1 management panel and mount the ISO image
file you created. Now we’re ready to return to our Native Oberon virtual
machine.</p>
<h2 id="installing-from-an-iso-cd-rom">Installing from an ISO
CD-ROM</h2>
<p>I suggest create the following as it’s own tool text. But if you want
you can also type in the commands and execute one by one.</p>
<pre><code>These are the instructions from installing the Native
Oberon 2.3.7 zip archive files. Steps:

1. See what the CD-ROM mount point by reviewing the partitions

    Paritions.Show ~

On my virtual machine the second disk is IDE2 and that
is where we&#39;ll find the CD-ROM.

2. Mount the ISO image as CD

    FileSystem.Mount CD ISOFS IDE2 ~

3. Check to see what files are on the CD-ROM

    System.Directory CD:* ~

4. Copy the files from the CD-ROM to the harddisk

    System.CopyFiles
        CD:Apps1.zip =&gt; Apps1.zip
        CD:Apps2.zip =&gt; Apps2.zip
        CD:Docu.zip =&gt; Docu.zip
        CD:Gadgets.zip =&gt; Gadgets.zip
        CD:Pr3Fonts.zip =&gt; Pr3Fonts.zip
        CD:Source1.zip =&gt; Source1.zip
        CD:Source2.zip =&gt; Source2.zip
        CD:Source3.zip =&gt; Source3.zip
        ~

5. Unzip all our archives using the ZipTool.

    ZipTool.ExtractAll \o \p SYS:
        Gadgets.zip Docu.zip Apps1.zip Apps2.zip
        Pr3Fonts.zip Pr6Fonts.zip
        Source1.zip Source2.zip Source3.zip
        ~
</code></pre>
<p>You should now have a full installed Native Oberon 2.3.7 system
running under VirtualBox 6.1. Enjoy your explorations.</p>
