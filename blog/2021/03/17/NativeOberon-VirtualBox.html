      <h1>ETH Oberon System 3 on VirtualBox 6.1</h1>
      <p>By R. S. Doiel, 2021-03-17</p>
      <p>In this post I am walking through installing Native Oberon 2.3.7
      (aka ETH Oberon System 3) on a virtual machine running under
      VirtualBox 6.1. It is a follow up to my 2019 post
      <a href="/blog/2019/07/28/freedos-to-oberon-system-3.html" title="Link to old blog post for bringing up Oberon System 3 in VirtualBox 6.0 using FreeDOS 1.2">FreeDOS to Oberon System 3</a>. To facilitate the install I will first prepare
      my virtual machine as a FreeDOS 1.2 box. This simplifies getting the
      virtual machines' hard disk partitioned and formatted correctly.
      When Native Oberon was released back in 1990's most Intel flavored
      machines shipped with some sort Microsoft OS on them.  I believe
      that is why the tools and instructions for Native Oberon assume
      you're installing over or along side a DOS partition.</p>
      <h2>Building our machine</h2>
      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <ol>
      <li>Install VirtualBox 6.1 installed on your host computer.</li>
      <li>Download and install a minimal FreeDOS 1.2 as a virtual machine</li>
      <li>Downloaded a copy of Native Oberon 2.3.7 alpha from SourceForge</li>
      <li>Familiarized yourself Oberon's Text User Interface</li>
      <li>Boot your FreeDOS virtual machine using the Oberon0.Dsk downloaded
      as part of NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz</li>
      <li>Mount &quot;Oberon0.Dsk&quot; and start installing Native Oberon</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Before you boot &quot;Oberon0.Dsk&quot; on your virtual machine make sure
      you've looked at some online Oberon documentation. This is important.
      Oberon is very different from macOS, Windows, Linux, DOS, CP/M or
      Unix. It is easy to read the instructions and miss important details
      like how you use the three button mouse, particularly the selections
      and execute actions of text instructions.</p>
      <h2>Virtual Machine Setup</h2>
      <p>VirtualBox 6.1 can be obtained from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">virtualbox.org</a>.  This involves downloading the installer for your particular host
      operating system (e.g. Linux, macOS or Windows) and follow the instructions
      on the VirtualBox website to complete the installation.</p>
      <p>Once VirtualBox is installed, launch VirtualBox.</p>
      <p>Click the &quot;New&quot; button and name your machine (e.g. &quot;Native Oberon 2.3.7 Alpha&quot;) and choose type of &quot;Other&quot; and version &quot;DOS&quot;. Click continue. I accepted
      the default memory size of 32 MB. This is plenty for Oberon.  I clicked on create disk and accepted the default VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image). Press continue. I think accepted &quot;Dynamically allocated&quot;, press continue. I chose a &quot;disk size&quot; of 100.00 MB. Oberon System is tiny. Press create button.</p>
      <p>Make sure your new machine is highlight on the left side of the VirtualBox
      management panel. Click on Settings button, it looks like a gear towards
      the top. Click &quot;Display&quot; on the model dialog and bump the Video Memory
      up to 128 MB. I also clicked Enable 3D Acceleration (though I don't think
      Oberon uses this).  Before clicking OK click on the Network icon in the
      modal dialog box. Change &quot;NAT&quot; to &quot;Bridged Adapter&quot;. Now click &quot;OK&quot; to
      close the modal dialog box.</p>
      <p>Your VirtualBox is now ready, before pressing &quot;Start&quot; we need
      to install FreeDOS 1.2.</p>
      <h2>Make a FreeDOS 1.2 machine</h2>
      <p>Download the <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.2/FD12CD.iso">FD12CD.iso</a> file from the
      <a href="https://freedos.org/download">FreeDOS project</a>.</p>
      <p>&quot;Insert&quot; the &quot;FD12CD.ISO&quot; file into our VirtualBox 6.1
      CD-ROM drive. Go to the VirtualBox management panel.
      In the area that summarizes storage click the word &quot;Empty&quot;
      in the line with &quot;[Optical Drive]&quot;. Find the &quot;FD12CD.ISO&quot;
      you downloaded and select it.</p>
      <p>Now press the green &quot;Start&quot; arrow in the VirtualBox management
      panel. This should start your virtual machine and it will boot
      using the CD-ROM drive.</p>
      <p>This will display a welcome screen with installation options.
      Press your &quot;tab&quot; key once. This should cause a boot string to be
      displayed. Type a space and then type the word &quot;raw&quot; (without quotes).
      Press enter. Next select the language you want to install with
      (e.g. English). Choose &quot;Yes - Continue with installation&quot; on the
      next prompt. You should then be given a dialog box that
      indicates &quot;Drive C: does not appear to be partitioned.&quot;, select
      &quot;Yes - Partition drive C:&quot;. Then that completes press
      &quot;Yes - Please reboot now&quot;.</p>
      <p>This will cause the machine to reboot and you will be faced with
      the &quot;Welcome to FreeDOS 1.2&quot; screen once again. Press the &quot;tab&quot;
      Add a space and type &quot;raw&quot; to the boot string as before.
      Select the language again then select &quot;Yes - Continue with
      installation&quot;. The screen should now say something like
      &quot;Drive C: does not appear to be formatted&quot;, select
      &quot;Yes - Please erase and format drive C:&quot;.</p>
      <p>When done it'll gather some info on the system and ask you
      which keyboard you're using. Pick yours (e.g. &quot;US English (Default)&quot;).
      It will then give you a choice of what to install. Since we're
      going to overwrite this when we install Oberon just select
      the base package, then select &quot;Yes - Please install FreeDOS 1.2&quot;</p>
      <p>Before selecting &quot;Yes - Please reboot now&quot; when the install is
      finished you want to &quot;eject&quot; your FD12CD.ISO from the virtual
      CD-ROM drive.  Switch back to your VirtualBox management panel.
      Click the text that says &quot;FD12CD.iso&quot; and select &quot;remove disk
      from virtual drive&quot; in the popup menu. Switch back to your
      Virtual machine and select &quot;Yes - Please reboot now&quot;</p>
      <p>If all goes well the machine will boot into FreeDOS 1.2. When
      you see the &quot;C:&gt;&quot; prompt type &quot;shutdown&quot; (without the quotes)
      and press enter. We're now ready to start installing Native
      Oberon 2.3.7.</p>
      <h2>Native Oberon 2.3.7</h2>
      <p>Native Oberon used to be hosted at ETH where Oberon and the Oberon
      System was first developed as a research and instructional project.
      Unfortunately this seems to no longer be supported by ETH. Prof. Wirth
      has long been retired now and they no longer choose to use such a
      useful language or Operating System.</p>
      <p>SourceForge has a mirror of the original sources and some of the
      remaining community has put at a &quot;new&quot; release of 2.3.7 Alpha
      bringing Native Oberon a little closer to the present. It's this
      version we'll use. You can read more at the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/">SourceForge</a> as well as at the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Oberon">Oberon Wikibook</a>. ETH also still maintains an email
      list for Oberon and it is active. It can be found at<a href="https://lists.inf.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/oberon">https://lists.inf.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/oberon</a>. I recommend
      browsing the archives of the Email list if you run into problems.
      I've found very helpful information there and the people on the
      list seem happy to answer a novices question.</p>
      <p>We are going to be downloading files from the Native Oberon Project's
      Files page at SourceForge.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/files/nativeoberon/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/files/nativeoberon/</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In the Files page download the instructions
      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/files/NativeOberonInstall.pdf/download">NativeOberonInstall.pdf</a>
      or or the text version. This document by Pieter Muller (May 1999) explains
      the installation process. It is good for its overview though I found
      the actual process simpler than what was described for May 1999.</p>
      <p>On the Files page you'll also see a green button to &quot;Download Latest Version&quot;, NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz. Click the button and download it.</p>
      <p>The NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz contains the files we'll need to run
      NativeOberon on our VirtualBox. Ungzip and untar the file into
      a location that is convenient for you. I put mine
      in <code>src/NativeOberon-2.3.7</code> and I had downloaded the file into my
      home directory's &quot;Downloads&quot; folder.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-shell">    mkdir -p src/NativeOberon-2.3.7
          cd src/NativeObeorn-2.3.7
          tar zxvf ~/Downloads/NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz
      </code></pre>
      <p>You now have the software ready to proceed in installing the system
      in VirtualBox.</p>
      <h2>NativeOberon in a VirtualBox</h2>
      <p>Go back to your VirtualBox management panel. We need to place
      he boot disk image in the virtual floppy drive. In the files
      we unpacked (i.e. ungzip and untar) there is a file named
      &quot;Oberon0.Dsk&quot;.  We want to mount that in the virtual floppy drive.
      Click on the word &quot;Empty&quot; next to &quot;Floppy Device 0:&quot; in the management
      panel. You are then given a modal dialog box and we want to select
      &quot;Choose a disk file&quot;. You can then find the files you save and
      select &quot;Oberon0.Dsk&quot;.</p>
      <h2>Booting with Oberon0.Dsk</h2>
      <p>We can now click &quot;Start&quot; button at the top of the VirtualBox management
      panel. This will boot the virtual machine using &quot;Oberon0.Dsk&quot;. Oberon
      itself loads completely into memory.</p>
      <p>You now have a running Oberon System but we need to install it
      on the virtual hard drive. Fortunately our running system comes with
      built in instructions.  It is here that people how haven't
      used Oberon before are going to run into trouble.</p>
      <p>Oberon System uses all three buttons of a three button mouse. On
      most mice I've encountered to day there are two buttons and a
      scroll wheel. The scroll wheel is click able and functions like
      the middle button on an Oberon mouse.</p>
      <p>The left mount button sets the pointer, the middle button (our
      scroll wheel if your mouse is like mine) is used to execute
      commands and the right mouse button is used to select text.
      In our installation instructions displayed on our virtual
      machine we generally be middle clicking the blue colored text.</p>
      <p>In Native Oberon all text is potentially actionable.  Unlike in
      Unix where you type a command press enter then have to retype
      (or use the command history) to execute the next command we're
      going to click on the text and sometimes select text to execute
      commands.  Before we proceed I highly recommend readying
      and trying a tutorial out before attempting to install Oberon
      on your virtual hard drive. There is an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171226183816/http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/ethoberon/tutorial/">Oberon System 3 - Main Tutorial</a> available at the Internet Archive's Wayback machine.</p>
      <h2>Installing to our Virtual Hard disk</h2>
      <p>Along the right side (in the system track) is the text &quot;Edit.Open Introduction.Text&quot;. Click with your middle button (scroll wheel on my
      mouse) and this will open the text in the &quot;Edit&quot; track on the left
      side.  Read this text if you haven't before. Scrolling through
      the text is a little different than the scroll bars on macOS, Windows,
      X Windows. They are on the left side and the middle mouse button
      sets the scroll position. The left button pages down, the right
      pages up.  You can close the &quot;Introduction.Text&quot; windows by
      middle clicking &quot;System.Close&quot; in the upper menu bar.</p>
      <h2>Review step 1.</h2>
      <p>We need to configure the hard drive by middle clicking on
      &quot;Config.Desk Standard ATA/EIDE&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In the console viewer above
      you should see something like</p>
      <pre><code>Disk: Standard ATA/EIDE
      Static BootLinker for OM Object Files / prk
       linking Native.Bin 255388
      </code></pre>
      <h2>Review step 2.</h2>
      <p>Middle click on &quot;Edit.Open InstallFiles.Tool&quot;.  A &quot;Tool&quot; file
      is like a text file but usually contains instructions and
      a sorta menu or recipe of commands.  In fact our instructions
      in the lower viewer of the system track is a &quot;Tool&quot; file called
      &quot;Install.Tool&quot;.  Using &quot;Edit.Open&quot; to open the tool or text file
      opens a viewer on the left track, the edit track. If you had
      clicked on &quot;System.Open Install.Tool&quot; it would open a viewer
      on the right, or systems track. In either track by default
      the viewers will tile (not overlap).  If you want to close
      a view you can click on &quot;System.Close&quot; in the viewer's menu
      bar. Now open our InstallFiles.Tool in the edit track.</p>
      <h2>InstallFiles.Tool</h2>
      <p>We now are going to prepare our virtual hard drive. Like
      our &quot;Install.Tool&quot; text we have a series of instructions
      which commands we can click on (the ones in blue).</p>
      <p>Middle click on &quot;Partitions.Show ~&quot;. This will open a pain
      showing the partition information. You should see something
      like</p>
      <pre><code>Disk: Diskette0, GetSize: no media, removable
      
      Disk: IDE0, 99MB, VBOX HARDDISK
      IDE0#00        99MB  --- (Whole disk)
      IDE0#01        99MB  --- (Free)
      
      Disk: IDE2, GetSize: no media, removable, VBOX CD-ROM
      </code></pre>
      <p>This tells us we have three drives in our VirtualBox
      visible to Oberon.  The first is the floppy drive.
      It shows &quot;no media&quot;. That might seem odd but when you
      read the &quot;Oberon0.Dsk&quot; it read that into memory and the
      whole OS is not running in memory, not from disk! While
      the disk is still &quot;in the drive&quot; as far as VirtualBox
      is concerned it isn't &quot;mounted&quot; from the point of view of
      the operating system.</p>
      <p>The second disk section describes our virtual hard drive.
      The third describes the virtual CD-ROM drive.</p>
      <p>We're interested in using the disk &quot;IDE0&quot; with the
      device number of &quot;01&quot;, we express that as &quot;IDE0#01&quot;.</p>
      <p>In the &quot;Partitions.Text&quot; viewer where we see the
      partitions information we can type the command
      described in &quot;InstallFiles.Tool&quot;</p>
      <pre><code>Partitions.ChangeType IDE0#01 6 76 ~
      </code></pre>
      <p>We then middle mouse click on line we just type. This
      should produce output in the &quot;System.Log&quot; view in the
      upper right of the screen that looks like</p>
      <pre><code>IDE0#01 changed to type 76
      </code></pre>
      <p>I had to do a modified version of step 3 of &quot;InstallFiles.Tool&quot;
      choosing option &quot;b&quot;.</p>
      <p>In the output of &quot;Partitions.show ~&quot; (i.e. the Partitions.Text
      viewer) want to middle click on the &quot;I&quot; of &quot;IDE0#01&quot;.
      Then right mouse button select &quot;IDE0#01&quot;.</p>
      <p>From 3a in the &quot;InstallFiles.Tool&quot; viewer middle mouse button
      click on &quot;Partitions.Format ↑&quot;. This should result in
      the &quot;System.Log&quot; viewer showing</p>
      <pre><code>IDE0#01 format successful
      </code></pre>
      <p>After formatting the drive I was able to complete step 3b by
      middle clicking the commands as provided in the &quot;InstallFiles.Tool&quot;</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>NOTE: you may need to scroll that window to see all of step 3</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Middle click on &quot;Partitions.UpdateBootFile ↑&quot;
      The &quot;Systems.Log&quot; viewer should show</p>
      <pre><code>IDE#00 update successful
      </code></pre>
      <p>Middle click on &quot;FilesSystem.Mount DST AosFS ↑&quot; in 3b. The
      &quot;System.Log&quot; viewer should show</p>
      <pre><code>DST: mounted
      </code></pre>
      <p>We are ready for Step 4. This command does the brunt of the
      work of coping things over. The command &quot;Configuration.DoCommands&quot;
      take a list of Oberon commands and executes them one after the
      other. Middle Mouse click on &quot;Configuration.DoCommands&quot;.
      The &quot;System.Log&quot; viewer will show many messages that are
      a result of each command taken. Make sure there are no errors.
      The last series of commands renamed files so you should see
      something like</p>
      <pre><code>System.RenameFiles
      DST:Rel.Obeorn.Text =&gt; DST:Oberon.Text renaming
      DST:Rel.Network.Tool =&gt; DST:Network.Tool renaming
      DST:Rel.DOS.Tool =&gt; DST:DOS.Tool renaming
      </code></pre>
      <p>For step 5 of &quot;InstallFiles.Tool&quot; we can close our &quot;InstallFiles.Tool&quot;
      viewer by middle clicking on &quot;System.Close&quot; in the menu bar. You can
      also close the &quot;Partitions.Text&quot; viewer using its menu bar and
      middle clicking &quot;System.Close&quot;.</p>
      <p>Right now we've formatted our hard drive and copied a bunch of
      files too it. We still need to configuration our system before
      it is self hosting.</p>
      <p>In the &quot;Install.Tool&quot; viewer we want to open our &quot;Configure.Tool&quot;.
      Middle click on the &quot;Edit.Open Configure.Tool&quot;.</p>
      <h2>Configuring our Oberon System</h2>
      <p>The configuration tool breaks configuration into a series of
      parts. First part is configure the display in Part two
      we make the hard disk bootable.</p>
      <p>To configure out display we want to middle click on the blue text in
      &quot;Config.DetectVesa (BIOS cal might hang some systems!)&quot;.
      You will be presented with a list of screen resolutions. I middle
      clicked the blue text in &quot;Config.Vesa 00000147H 1600 * 1200 * 32&quot;.
      In the &quot;System.Log&quot; viewer this showed</p>
      <pre><code>Vesa mode 00000147H
      </code></pre>
      <blockquote>
      <p>NOTE: You will likely need to scroll down the page using the scroll bar</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In part two we need to decide how we want to boot Oberon. In our case
      I recommend Option 2, boot Oberon directly (non-FAT hosted). Middle
      click the blue text &quot;Config.BootParition menu ~&quot;.
      The &quot;System.Log&quot; viewer should output</p>
      <pre><code>IDE0#01 config written
      </code></pre>
      <p>Middle click the blue text &quot;Partitions.Show ~&quot;. Like in
      &quot;InstallFiles.Tool&quot; this will open a new &quot;Partitions.Text&quot;
      viewer with content like</p>
      <pre><code>Disk: Diskette0, GetSize: no media, removable
      
      Disk: IDE0, 99MB, VBOX HARDDISK
      IDE0#00       99MB  --- (Whole disk)
      IDE0#01       99MB   76 * Native Oberon, Aos
      
      Disk: IDE2, GetSize: no media, removable, VBOX CD-ROM
      </code></pre>
      <p>Using your right mouse button select &quot;IDE0#01&quot; then in the
      &quot;Configure.Tool&quot; viewer middle click the blue text
      &quot;Partitions.Activate ↑&quot;. The &quot;System.Log&quot; viewer should
      show</p>
      <pre><code>IDE0#01 already active

      <p>We don't have a partition to deactivate so we can skip the last
      step of option 2. This is a good place to &quot;eject&quot; our
      floppy disk &quot;Oberon0.Dsk&quot; before we &quot;System.Reboot&quot;.</p>
      <p>To eject the disk click on &quot;Oberon0.Dsk&quot; in the VirtualBox
      manager panel. The should then change the text to &quot;Empty&quot;.</p>
      <p>Finally we're ready to move to the last step in &quot;Configure.Tool&quot;.
      Scroll down and find &quot;System.Reboot&quot;.
      Middle click on the blue text &quot;System.Reboot&quot;. At this point
      the virtualbox should reboot from the virtual hard drive.
      This reboot will take a little longer than the floppy boot
      and the screen size of the virtualbox will be large based on the
      settings you picked early. You have a minimal working Oberon
      System 3. Now to install some more programs and flesh the system out.</p>
      <h2>Install some programs</h2>
      <p>First we need to get the zip files provided in
      NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz on to the hard drive.<br>
      Historically these were done via 1.44 MB floppy disks.
      We're going to make it easier. Native Oberon 2.3.7 can
      read an ISO formatted CD-ROM.</p>
      <h2>Making our virtual CD-ROM</h2>
      <p>Under Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS machine creating a ISO image
      is one command. Below is I am going to create an ISO
      image of the directory &quot;NativeOberon-2.3.7&quot;
      and save the image as &quot;NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso&quot;.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-shell">    mkisofs -J --iso-level 3 \
              -o NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso NativeOberon-2.3.7
      </code></pre>
      <p>The <code>-J</code> says to use the Joliet extensions, the <code>--iso-level</code>
      sets the level of ISO support, in this case to 3. See
      the manpage for <code>mkisofs</code> for details.</p>
      <p>On macOS this involves two commands. First use
      the &quot;Disk Utility&quot; to create an image of the folder
      where you unpacked NativeOberon_2.3.7.tar.gz.
      This will result in a &quot;.dmg&quot; or disk image file common
      on macOS.  Next we need to convert this to an ISO
      formatted image file.  For that we use a command line
      macOS tool called <code>hdiutil</code> to convert the disk
      image to an ISO format. In the process you will create
      the ISO file but it will have the extension of &quot;.cdr&quot;.
      You can rename (i.e. mv) that file so it has a &quot;.iso&quot;
      extension. This is suitable to mount in VirtualBox's
      virtual CD-ROM drive.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-shell">    hdiutil convert NativeOberon-2.3.7.dmg -format UDTO -o NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso
          mv NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso.cdr NativeOberon-2.3.7.iso
      </code></pre>
      <p>Go to the VirtualBox 6.1 management panel and mount the
      ISO image file you created. Now we're ready to return
      to our Native Oberon virtual machine.</p>
      <h2>Installing from an ISO CD-ROM</h2>
      <p>I suggest create the following as it's own tool text.
      But if you want you can also type in the commands and
      execute one by one.</p>
      <pre><code>These are the instructions from installing the Native
      Oberon 2.3.7 zip archive files. Steps:
      
      1. See what the CD-ROM mount point by reviewing the partitions
      
          Paritions.Show ~
      
      On my virtual machine the second disk is IDE2 and that
      is where we'll find the CD-ROM.
      
      2. Mount the ISO image as CD
      
          FileSystem.Mount CD ISOFS IDE2 ~
      
      3. Check to see what files are on the CD-ROM
      
          System.Directory CD:* ~
      
      4. Copy the files from the CD-ROM to the harddisk
      
          System.CopyFiles
              CD:Apps1.zip =&gt; Apps1.zip
              CD:Apps2.zip =&gt; Apps2.zip
              CD:Docu.zip =&gt; Docu.zip
              CD:Gadgets.zip =&gt; Gadgets.zip
              CD:Pr3Fonts.zip =&gt; Pr3Fonts.zip
              CD:Source1.zip =&gt; Source1.zip
              CD:Source2.zip =&gt; Source2.zip
              CD:Source3.zip =&gt; Source3.zip
              ~
      
      5. Unzip all our archives using the ZipTool.
      
          ZipTool.ExtractAll \o \p SYS:
              Gadgets.zip Docu.zip Apps1.zip Apps2.zip
              Pr3Fonts.zip Pr6Fonts.zip
              Source1.zip Source2.zip Source3.zip
              ~
      
      </code></pre>
      <p>You should now have a full installed Native Oberon 2.3.7
      system running under VirtualBox 6.1. Enjoy your explorations.</p>
