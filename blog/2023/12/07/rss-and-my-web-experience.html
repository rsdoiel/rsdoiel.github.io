<h1 id="rss-and-my-web-experience">RSS and my web experience</h1>
<p>by R. S. Doiel, 2023-12-07</p>
<p>I agree with <a
href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/07/140505.html?title=whyWeWantFeedsInBluesky">Dave
Winer</a>, Blue Sky should support RSS. Most web systems benefit from
supporting RSS. RSS is a base level inter-opt for web software like HTML
and JSON can be. While I may not be typical I am an example of a web
user who experiences much of the web via RSS. I read blog and site
content via RSS. I “follow” my friends and colleagues via RSS. This is
true when they blog or when they post in a Mastodon community. I track
academic repositories content for <a
href="https://www.rc-blog.ethz.ch/en/feed">ETH Zurich Research</a> and
<a
href="https://feeds.library.caltech.edu/recent/combined.html">Caltech</a>
via RSS feeds. I check the weather via NOAA’s <a
href="https://www.weather.gov/rss">RSS feed</a>. News sites often
syndicate still via RSS and then Podcasts, if they are actual Podcasts
are distributed via RSS. All this is to say I think RSS is not dead. It
remains easy to render can can be easy to consume. If a website doesn’t
provide it it is possible to generate it yourself[1] or find a service
to use that does[2]. RSS remains key to how I experience and use the web
in 2023.</p>
<p>[1]: Go libraries like <a href="https://go-colly.org/">Colly</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed">Gofeeds</a> make it possible
to roll your own like the one in skimmer</p>
<p>[2]: https://firesky.tv/ is an example of a service that provides RSS
for Bluesky via its raw API, <a
href="https://html2rss.github.io/">html2rss</a> is service that
producing RSS feeds for popular sites that don’t include them</p>
<p>My personal approach to feeds is very much tailored to me. It’s
probably overkill for most people but it works with my vision and
cognitive limitations. He’s the steps I take in feed reading. They
essentially decompose a traditional feed reader and allow for more
flexibility for my reading pleasure.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Maintain a list of feeds in a simple text file</li>
<li>Harvest those feeds with <a
href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/skimmer">skimmer</a>, Skimmer stores the
items in an <a href="https://sqlite.org">SQLite3</a></li>
<li>I filter the items using SQL and SQLite3 or via an interactive mode
provided by Skimmer</li>
<li>Render saved items to Markdown with <a
href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/skimmer/skim2md.1.html">skim2md</a></li>
<li>Use <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> to render the Markdown
and view Firefox</li>
</ol>
<p>The nice thing about this approach is that I can easily script it
with Bash or even a Windows bat. I can easily maintain separate lists
and separate databases for personal and work related material. A bonus
is the database items can also serve as a corpus for a personal search
engine too. If you want to save maintain a public reading list this
setup is ideal too. Of course the list of curated items can be
transformed into their own RSS feed as well.</p>
<p><a
href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/skimmer/skimmer.1.html">Skimmer</a> is a
deconstructed feed reader. Does that make it post modern feed reader?
Skimmer processes a list of feeds I follow and saves the results in an
SQLite 3 database. That database can be used to filter the feeds and
flag items as “saved”. Typically I filter by timestamps. Saved items can
be processed with <code>skim2md</code> to render a markdown document.
<code>skim2md</code> has an option to include a “save to pocket” button
for each item in the output. I use Pandoc to render the page then view
that result in Firefox. At my leisure I read the web page and press the
“Save to pocket” button any item I want to read later. It’s a very
comfortable experience.</p>
<p>Skimmer lead me to think about a personal news page for myself and
family. Skimmer lets me curate separate lists organized around themes.
These can then be rendered to individual pages like pages of a
newspaper. This has been captured in an experimental project I call <a
href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna">Antenna</a>. It even includes a
feed search feature thanks to <a
href="https://pagefind.app">PageFind</a></p>
