      <h1>RSS and my web experience</h1>
      <p>by R. S. Doiel, 2023-12-07</p>
      <p>I agree with <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/07/140505.html?title=whyWeWantFeedsInBluesky">Dave Winer</a>, Blue Sky should support RSS. Most web systems benefit from supporting RSS. RSS is a base level inter-opt for web software like HTML and JSON can be. While I may not be typical I am an example of a web user who experiences much of the web via RSS. I read blog and site content via RSS. I &quot;follow&quot; my friends and colleagues via RSS. This is true when they blog or when they post in a Mastodon community.  I track academic repositories content for <a href="https://www.rc-blog.ethz.ch/en/feed">ETH Zurich Research</a> and <a href="https://feeds.library.caltech.edu/recent/combined.html">Caltech</a> via RSS feeds. I check the weather via NOAA's <a href="https://www.weather.gov/rss">RSS feed</a>.  News sites often syndicate still via RSS and then Podcasts, if they are actual Podcasts are distributed via RSS.  All this is to say I think RSS is not dead. It remains easy to render can can be easy to consume.  If a website doesn't provide it it is possible to generate it yourself[1] or find a service to use that does[2]. RSS remains key to how I experience and use the web in 2023.</p>
      <p>[1]: Go libraries like <a href="https://go-colly.org/">Colly</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed">Gofeeds</a> make it possible to roll your own like the one in skimmer</p>
      <p>[2]: <a href="https://firesky.tv/">https://firesky.tv/</a> is an example of a service that provides RSS for Bluesky via its raw API, <a href="https://html2rss.github.io/">html2rss</a> is service that producing RSS feeds for popular sites that don't include them</p>
      <p>My personal approach to feeds is very much tailored to me. It's probably overkill for most people but it works with my vision and cognitive limitations. He's the steps I take in feed reading. They essentially decompose a traditional feed reader and allow for more flexibility for my reading pleasure.</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Maintain a list of feeds in a simple text file</li>
      <li>Harvest those feeds with <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/skimmer">skimmer</a>, Skimmer stores the items in an <a href="https://sqlite.org">SQLite3</a></li>
      <li>I filter the items using SQL and SQLite3 or via an interactive mode provided by Skimmer</li>
      <li>Render saved items to Markdown with <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/skimmer/skim2md.1.html">skim2md</a></li>
      <li>Use <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> to render the Markdown and view Firefox</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The nice thing about this approach is that I can easily script it with Bash or even a Windows bat. I can easily maintain separate lists and separate databases for personal and work related material.  A bonus is the database items can also serve as a corpus for a personal search engine too. If you want to save maintain a public reading list this setup is ideal too. Of course the list of curated items can be transformed into their own RSS feed as well.</p>
      <p><a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/skimmer/skimmer.1.html">Skimmer</a> is a deconstructed feed reader. Does that make it post modern feed reader?  Skimmer processes a list of feeds I follow and saves the results in an SQLite 3 database. That database can be used to filter the feeds and flag items as &quot;saved&quot;. Typically I filter by timestamps. Saved items can be processed with <code>skim2md</code> to render a markdown document. <code>skim2md</code> has an option to include a &quot;save to pocket&quot; button for each item in the output. I use Pandoc to render the page then view that result in Firefox. At my leisure I read the web page and press the &quot;Save to pocket&quot; button any item I want to read later. It's a very comfortable experience.</p>
      <p>Skimmer lead me to think about a personal news page for myself and family. Skimmer lets me curate separate lists organized around themes. These can then be rendered to individual pages like pages of a newspaper. This has been captured in an experimental project I call <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna">Antenna</a>. It even includes a feed search feature thanks to <a href="https://pagefind.app">PageFind</a></p>
