      <h1>skimmer</h1>
      <p>By R. S. Doiel, 2023-10-06</p>
      <p>I have a problem. I like to read my feeds in newsboat but I can't seem to get it working on a few machines I use.
      I miss having access to read feeds. Additionally there are times I would like to read my feeds in the same way
      I read twtxt feeds using <code>yarnc timeline | less -R</code>. Just get a list of all items in reverse chronological order.</p>
      <p>I am not interested in reinventing newsboat, it does a really good job, but I do want an option where newsboat isn't
      available or is not not convenient to use.  This lead me to think about an experiment I am calling skimmer
      . Something that works with RSS, Atom and jsonfeeds in the same way I use <code>yarnc timeline | less -R</code>.<br>
      I'm also inspired by Dave Winer's a river of news site and his outline tooling. But in this case I don't want
      an output style output, just a simple list of items in reverse chronological order. I'm thinking of a more
      ephemeral experience in reading.</p>
      <p>This has left me with some questions.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>How simple is would it be to write skimmer?</li>
      <li>How much effort would be required to maintain it?</li>
      <li>Could this tool incorporate support for other feed types, e.g. twtxt, Gopher, Gemini?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is a Go package called <a href="https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed">gofeed</a>. The README describes it
      as a &quot;universal&quot; feed reading parser. That seems like a good starting point and picking a very narrowly
      focus task seems like a way to keep the experiment simple to implement.</p>
      <h2>Design issues</h2>
      <p>The reader tool needs to output to standard out in the same manner as <code>yarnc timeline</code> does. The goal isn't
      to be newsboat, or river of news, drummer, or Lynx but to present a stream of items usefully formatted to read
      from standard output.</p>
      <p>Some design ideas</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Feeds should be fetched by the same tool as the reader but that should be done explicitly (downloads can take a while)</li>
      <li>I want to honor that RSS does not require titles! I need to handle that case gracefully</li>
      <li>For a given list of feed URLs I want to save the content in a SQLite3 database (useful down the road)</li>
      <li>I'd like the simplicity of newsboat's URL list but I want to eventually support OPML import/export</li>
      </ol>
      <h1>Skimmer, a thin wrapper around gofeed</h1>
      <p>In terms of working with RSS, Atom and JSON feeds the <a href="https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed">gofeed</a> takes care of
      all the heavy lifting in parsing that content. The go http package provides a reliable client.
      There is a pure Go package, <a href="">go-sqlite</a>, for integrating with SQLite 3 database. The real task is knitting this
      together and a convenient package.</p>
      <p>Here's some ideas about behavior.</p>
      <p>To configure skimmer you just run the command. It'll create a directory at <code>$HOME/.skimmer</code> to store configuration
      much like newsboat does with <code>$HOME/.newsboat</code>.</p>
      <pre><code>skimmer
      </code></pre>
      <p>A default URL list to be created so when running the command you have something to fetch and read.</p>
      <p>Since fetching feed content can be slow (this is true of all news readers I've used) I think you should have to
      explicitly say fetch.</p>
      <pre><code>skimmer -fetch
      </code></pre>
      <p>This would read the URLs in the URL list and populate a simple SQLite 3 database table. Then running skimmer again
      would display any harvested content (or running skimmer in another terminal session).</p>
      <p>Since we're accumulating data in a database there are some house keep chores like prune that need to be supported.
      Initial this can be very simple and if the experiment move forward I can improve them over time. I want something
      like saying prune everything up to today.</p>
      <pre><code>skimmer -prune today
      </code></pre>
      <p>There are times I just want to limit the number of items displayed so a limit options makes sense</p>
      <pre><code>skimmer -limit 10
      </code></pre>
      <p>Since I am displaying to standard out I should be able to output via Pandoc to pretty print the content.</p>
      <pre><code>skimmer -limit 50 | pandoc -t markdown -f plain | less -R
      </code></pre>
      <p>That seems a like a good set of design features for an initial experiment.</p>
      <h2>Proof of concept implementation</h2>
      <p>Spending a little time this evening. I've release a proof of concept on GitHub
      at <a href="https://github.com/rsdoiel/skimmer">https://github.com/rsdoiel/skimmer</a>, you can read the initial documentation
      at <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/skimmer">skimmer</a>.</p>
