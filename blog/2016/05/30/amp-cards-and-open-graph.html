Articles, Accelerated Mobile Pages, Twitter Cards and Open Graph</h1>

<h2><a name="the-problem">The problem</a></h2>
<p>The web has gotten slow. In <a
href="http://httparchive.org/trends.php">2016</a> the average page
weight is in multi-megabytes and the average number of network requests
needed to deliver the content is counted in the hundreds. In the mix are
saturated networks and a continued public expectation of responsiveness
(web wisdom suggests you have about 3 seconds before people give up).
The odd thing is we’ve known how to build fast websites for a <a
href="https://www.stevesouders.com/">decade</a> or so.<br />
Collectively we don’t build them <a
href="https://www.sitepoint.com/average-page-weight-increased-another-16-2015/">fast</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="meet-the-new-abstractions">Meet the new abstractions</a></h2>
<p>Corporations believe they have the answer and they are providing us
with another set of abstractions. In a few years maybe these will get
distilled down to a shared common view but in the mean time disc costs
remain reasonably priced and generating these new forms of pages or
feeds is a template or so away.</p>

<h2><a name="the-players">The players</a></h2>
<h3 id="twitter-cards-and-open-graph">Twitter Cards and Open Graph</h3>
<p>Twitter’s Titter Cards and Facebook’s Open Graph offer approaches to
build off of our existing meta elements in an HTML page’s document head.
They are named space to avoid collisions but supporting both will still
result in some content duplication. The k-weight difference in the
resulting HTML pages isn’t too bad.</p>
<p>Adopting either or both is a matter of adjusting how your render your
web page’s head block. It is easy enough to do manually but easier still
using some sort of template system that renders the appropriate meta
elements based on the content type and contents in the page being
rendered.</p>
<p>Google and other search engines can leverage this richer meta data
and integrate it into their results. Google’s Now application can render
content cards based on either semantic. It also appears that content
cards are being leverage selectively for an aside and related content on
Google search results pages. You could even built this into your own
indexing process for use with the Solr or Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>Content Cards offer intriguing opportunity for web crawlers and
search engines. This is particularly true when combined with mature feed
formats like RSS, OPML, Atom and the maturing efforts in the linked data
community around JSON-LD.</p>
<h3 id="amp---accelerated-mobile-pages">AMP - Accelerated Mobile
Pages</h3>
<p>The backers of AMP (not to be confused with Apache+MySQL+PHP) are
largely publishers including major news outlets and web media companies
in the US and Europe. This is an abridged list from 2015–</p>
<ul>
<li>BBC</li>
<li>Atlantic Media</li>
<li>Vox Media</li>
<li>Conde Nast</li>
<li>New York Times</li>
<li>Wall Street Journal</li>
<li>The Daily Mail</li>
<li>Huffington Post</li>
<li>Gannet</li>
<li>The Guardian</li>
<li>The Economist</li>
<li>The Financial Times</li>
</ul>
<p>In additional to the publishers there is participation by tech
companies such as Google, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn and
Wordpress.com. Accelerated Mobile Pages offer benefits for web crawlers
and search engines supporting surfacing content is clearly and enabling
easier distinction from advertisements.</p>
<h3 id="instant-articles">Instant Articles</h3>
<p>In additional to Open Graph Facebook has put forward <a
href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles">Instant
Articles</a>. Like AMP it is targeting content delivery for mobile.
Unlike AMP Instant Articles is an explicit binding into Facebook’s
walled garden only exposing the content on supported versions of iOS and
Android. You don’t see Instant Articles in your Facebook timeline or
when<br />
you browse from a desktop web browser. Unlike the previous examples you
actually need to sign up to participate in the Instant Article
publishing process. Sign up cost is having a Facebook account, being
approved by Facebook and compliance with their terms of service.
Facebook does provide some publishing tools, publishing controls as well
as some analytics. They do allow 3rd party ads as well as encourage
access to their advertising network. Once approved the burden on your
content manage process appears manageable.</p>
<p>You can submit Instant Articles via a modified RSS feed or directly
through their API. In this sense the overhead is about the same as that
for implementing support for Twitter Cards Open Graph, and AMP. Facebook
does a good job of quickly propagating changes to your Instant Articles
across their platform. That’s nice.</p>
<p>Why go through the trouble? If you’re a content producer and your
audience lives on Facebook Facebook commands the attention of a lot of
eye balls. Instant Articles provides another avenue to reach them. For
some Facebook effectively controls the public view of the web much as
America Online and Prodigy did decades ago. <a
href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">Dave Winer</a> has written
extensively on how he implemented Instant Article support along with
some very reasoned pros and cons for doing so. The landscape is evolving
and <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave’s river of news</a> is worth
following.</p>
<h2><a name="impact-on-building-content">Impact on building content</a></h2>
<p>These approaches require changes in your production of your HTML and
RSS sent to the browser. Twitter Cards and Open Graph change what you
put in the HEAD element of the HTML pages. AMP proscribes what you
should put in the BODY element of the webpage. Instant Articles tweaks
your RSS output. Not surprisingly the major content management systems
Wordpress and Drupal have plugins for this. All can be implemented via
your template system or page generation process.</p>
<h2><a name="whither-adopt">Whither adopt?</a></h2>
<p>Because these approaches boil down to content assembly the adoption
risk is low. If your audience views Twitter, Facebook or Google search
results then it is probably worth doing. All allow you to continue to
publish your own content and own your URLs as opposed to being a tenant
on one or another platform. That benefits the open web.</p>
