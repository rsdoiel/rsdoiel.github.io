      <h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
      <p>The web has gotten slow. In <a href="http://httparchive.org/trends.php">2016</a> the<br />
      average page weight is in multi-megabytes and the average number of network<br />
      requests needed to deliver the content is counted in<br />
      the hundreds. In the mix are saturated networks and a continued public<br />
      expectation of responsiveness (web wisdom suggests you have about 3 seconds<br />
      before people give up).  The odd thing is we've known how to build fast<br />
      websites for a <a href="https://www.stevesouders.com/">decade</a> or so.<br />
      Collectively we don't build them <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/average-page-weight-increased-another-16-2015/">fast</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="meet-the-new-abstractions">Meet the new abstractions</h2>
      <p>Corporations believe they have the answer and they are providing us<br />
      with another set of abstractions. In a few years maybe these will<br />
      get distilled down to a shared common view but in the mean time disc<br />
      costs remain reasonably priced and generating these new forms of<br />
      pages or feeds is a template or so away.</p>

      <h3 id="twitter-cards-and-open-graph">Twitter Cards and Open Graph</h3>
      <p>Twitter's Titter Cards and Facebook's Open Graph offer approaches to<br />
      build off of our existing meta elements in an HTML page's document<br />
      head.  They are named space to avoid collisions but supporting both<br />
      will still result in some content duplication. The k-weight<br />
      difference in the resulting HTML pages isn't too bad.</p>
      <p>Adopting either or both is a matter of adjusting how your render your<br />
      web page's head block.  It is easy enough to do manually but easier<br />
      still using some sort of template system that renders the appropriate<br />
      meta elements based on the content type and contents in the page<br />
      being rendered.</p>
      <p>Google and other search engines can leverage this richer meta<br />
      data and integrate it into their results. Google's Now application can<br />
      render content cards based on either semantic. It also appears that<br />
      content cards are being leverage selectively for an aside and related<br />
      content on Google search results pages. You could even built this into<br />
      your own indexing process for use with the Solr or Elasticsearch.</p>
      <p>Content Cards offer intriguing opportunity for web crawlers and search<br />
      engines.  This is particularly true when combined with mature feed<br />
      formats like RSS, OPML, Atom and the maturing efforts in the linked<br />
      data community around JSON-LD.</p>
      <h3 id="amp---accelerated-mobile-pages">AMP - Accelerated Mobile Pages</h3>
      <p>The backers of AMP (not to be confused with Apache+MySQL+PHP) are largely<br />
      publishers including major news outlets and web media<br />
      companies in the US and Europe. This is an abridged list from 2015--</p>
      <ul>
      <li>BBC</li>
      <li>Atlantic Media</li>
      <li>Vox Media</li>
      <li>Conde Nast</li>
      <li>New York Times</li>
      <li>Wall Street Journal</li>
      <li>The Daily Mail</li>
      <li>Huffington Post</li>
      <li>Gannet</li>
      <li>The Guardian</li>
      <li>The Economist</li>
      <li>The Financial Times</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In additional to the publishers there is participation by tech companies<br />
      such as Google, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn and Wordpress.com.  Accelerated<br />
      Mobile Pages offer benefits for web crawlers and search engines supporting<br />
      surfacing content is clearly and enabling easier distinction from<br />
      advertisements.</p>
      <h3 id="instant-articles">Instant Articles</h3>
      <p>In additional to Open Graph Facebook has put forward <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles">Instant Articles</a>.<br />
      Like AMP it is targeting content delivery for mobile. Unlike AMP Instant Articles is an<br />
      explicit binding into Facebook's walled garden only exposing the content on supported<br />
      versions of iOS and Android. You don't see Instant Articles in your Facebook timeline or when<br />
      you browse from a desktop web browser.  Unlike the previous<br />
      examples you actually need to sign up to participate in the Instant Article publishing<br />
      process.  Sign up cost is having a Facebook account, being approved by Facebook and compliance<br />
      with their terms of service. Facebook does provide some publishing tools, publishing controls<br />
      as well as some analytics. They do allow 3rd party ads as well as encourage access to<br />
      their advertising network.  Once approved the burden on your content manage process<br />
      appears manageable.</p>
      <p>You can submit Instant Articles via a modified RSS feed or directly through their API.<br />
      In this sense the overhead is about the same as that for implementing support for Twitter Cards<br />
      Open Graph, and AMP. Facebook does a good job of quickly propagating changes to your<br />
      Instant Articles across their platform. That's nice.</p>
      <p>Why go through the trouble? If you're a content producer and your audience lives on Facebook<br />
      Facebook commands the attention of a lot of eye balls.  Instant Articles provides<br />
      another avenue to reach them.  For some Facebook effectively controls the public view of the<br />
      web much as America Online and Prodigy did decades ago. <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">Dave Winer</a><br />
      has written extensively on how he implemented Instant Article support along with<br />
      some very reasoned pros and cons for doing so. The landscape is evolving and<br />
      <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave's river of news</a> is worth following.</p>
      <h2 id="impact-on-building-content">Impact on building content</h2>
      <p>These approaches require changes in your production of your HTML and RSS sent to the browser.<br />
      Twitter Cards and Open Graph change what you put in the HEAD element of the HTML<br />
      pages.  AMP proscribes what you should put in the BODY element of the webpage.<br />
      Instant Articles tweaks your RSS output.  Not surprisingly the major content management<br />
      systems Wordpress and Drupal have plugins for this.  All can be implemented via your template<br />
      system or page generation process.</p>
      <h2 id="whither-adopt">Whither adopt?</h2>
      <p>Because these approaches boil down to content assembly the adoption risk<br />
      is low.  If your audience views Twitter, Facebook or Google search results<br />
      then it is probably worth doing.  All allow you to continue to publish your<br />
      own content and own your URLs as opposed to being a tenant on one or another<br />
      platform. That benefits the open web.</p>
