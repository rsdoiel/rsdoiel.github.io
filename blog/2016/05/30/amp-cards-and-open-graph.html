      <h1>Instant Articles, Accelerated Mobile Pages, Twitter Cards and Open Graph</h1>
      <p>By R. S. Doiel 2016-05-30</p>
      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p>The web has gotten slow. In <a href="http://httparchive.org/trends.php">2016</a> the
      average page weight is in multi-megabytes and the average number of network
      requests needed to deliver the content is counted in
      the hundreds. In the mix are saturated networks and a continued public
      expectation of responsiveness (web wisdom suggests you have about 3 seconds
      before people give up).  The odd thing is we've known how to build fast
      websites for a <a href="https://www.stevesouders.com/">decade</a> or so.<br>
      Collectively we don't build them <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/average-page-weight-increased-another-16-2015/">fast</a>.</p>
      <h2>Meet the new abstractions</h2>
      <p>Corporations believe they have the answer and they are providing us
      with another set of abstractions. In a few years maybe these will
      get distilled down to a shared common view but in the mean time disc
      costs remain reasonably priced and generating these new forms of
      pages or feeds is a template or so away.</p>

      </ul>
      <h2>The players</h2>
      <h3>Twitter Cards and Open Graph</h3>
      <p>Twitter's Titter Cards and Facebook's Open Graph offer approaches to
      build off of our existing meta elements in an HTML page's document
      head.  They are named space to avoid collisions but supporting both
      will still result in some content duplication. The k-weight
      difference in the resulting HTML pages isn't too bad.</p>
      <p>Adopting either or both is a matter of adjusting how your render your
      web page's head block.  It is easy enough to do manually but easier
      still using some sort of template system that renders the appropriate
      meta elements based on the content type and contents in the page
      being rendered.</p>
      <p>Google and other search engines can leverage this richer meta
      data and integrate it into their results. Google's Now application can
      render content cards based on either semantic. It also appears that
      content cards are being leverage selectively for an aside and related
      content on Google search results pages. You could even built this into
      your own indexing process for use with the Solr or Elasticsearch.</p>
      <p>Content Cards offer intriguing opportunity for web crawlers and search
      engines.  This is particularly true when combined with mature feed
      formats like RSS, OPML, Atom and the maturing efforts in the linked
      data community around JSON-LD.</p>
      <h3>AMP - Accelerated Mobile Pages</h3>
      <p>The backers of AMP (not to be confused with Apache+MySQL+PHP) are largely
      publishers including major news outlets and web media
      companies in the US and Europe. This is an abridged list from 2015--</p>
      <ul>
      <li>BBC</li>
      <li>Atlantic Media</li>
      <li>Vox Media</li>
      <li>Conde Nast</li>
      <li>New York Times</li>
      <li>Wall Street Journal</li>
      <li>The Daily Mail</li>
      <li>Huffington Post</li>
      <li>Gannet</li>
      <li>The Guardian</li>
      <li>The Economist</li>
      <li>The Financial Times</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In additional to the publishers there is participation by tech companies
      such as Google, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn and Wordpress.com.  Accelerated
      Mobile Pages offer benefits for web crawlers and search engines supporting
      surfacing content is clearly and enabling easier distinction from
      advertisements.</p>
      <h3>Instant Articles</h3>
      <p>In additional to Open Graph Facebook has put forward <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles">Instant Articles</a>.
      Like AMP it is targeting content delivery for mobile. Unlike AMP Instant Articles is an
      explicit binding into Facebook's walled garden only exposing the content on supported
      versions of iOS and Android. You don't see Instant Articles in your Facebook timeline or when<br>
      you browse from a desktop web browser.  Unlike the previous
      examples you actually need to sign up to participate in the Instant Article publishing
      process.  Sign up cost is having a Facebook account, being approved by Facebook and compliance
      with their terms of service. Facebook does provide some publishing tools, publishing controls
      as well as some analytics. They do allow 3rd party ads as well as encourage access to
      their advertising network.  Once approved the burden on your content manage process
      appears manageable.</p>
      <p>You can submit Instant Articles via a modified RSS feed or directly through their API.
      In this sense the overhead is about the same as that for implementing support for Twitter Cards
      Open Graph, and AMP. Facebook does a good job of quickly propagating changes to your
      Instant Articles across their platform. That's nice.</p>
      <p>Why go through the trouble? If you're a content producer and your audience lives on Facebook
      Facebook commands the attention of a lot of eye balls.  Instant Articles provides
      another avenue to reach them.  For some Facebook effectively controls the public view of the
      web much as America Online and Prodigy did decades ago. <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">Dave Winer</a>
      has written extensively on how he implemented Instant Article support along with
      some very reasoned pros and cons for doing so. The landscape is evolving and
      <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave's river of news</a> is worth following.</p>
      <h2>Impact on building content</h2>
      <p>These approaches require changes in your production of your HTML and RSS sent to the browser.
      Twitter Cards and Open Graph change what you put in the HEAD element of the HTML
      pages.  AMP proscribes what you should put in the BODY element of the webpage.
      Instant Articles tweaks your RSS output.  Not surprisingly the major content management
      systems Wordpress and Drupal have plugins for this.  All can be implemented via your template
      system or page generation process.</p>
      <h2>Whither adopt?</h2>
      <p>Because these approaches boil down to content assembly the adoption risk
      is low.  If your audience views Twitter, Facebook or Google search results
      then it is probably worth doing.  All allow you to continue to publish your
      own content and own your URLs as opposed to being a tenant on one or another
      platform. That benefits the open web.</p>
