## Model Extraction Attack on Neural Networks

date: 2023-10-09

<p>Adi Shamir et al. have a new <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1526.pdf">model extraction attack</a> on neural networks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Polynomial Time Cryptanalytic Extraction of Neural Network Models</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Billions of dollars and countless GPU hours are currently spent on training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for a variety of tasks. Thus, it is essential to determine the difficulty of extracting all the parameters of such neural networks when given access to their black-box implementations. Many versions of this problem have been studied over the last 30 years, and the best current attack on ReLU-based deep neural networks was presented at Crypto&#8217;20 by Carlini, Jagielski, and Mironov. It resembles a differential chosen plaintext attack on a cryptosystem, which has a secret key embedded in its black-box implementation and requires a polynomial number of queries but an exponential amount of time (as a function of the number of neurons)...</p></blockquote>

## Hacking Gas Pumps via Bluetooth

date: 2023-10-02

<p>Turns out pumps at gas stations are controlled via Bluetooth, and that the connections are <a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/detroit-man-steals-800-gallons-using-bluetooth-to-hack-gas-pumps-at-station">insecure</a>. No details in the article, but it seems that it&#8217;s easy to take control of the pump and have it dispense gas without requiring payment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a complicated crime to monetize, though. You need to sell access to the gas pump to others.</p>

## Critical Vulnerability in libwebp Library

date: 2023-09-25

<p>Both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/apple-patches-clickless-0-day-image-processing-vulnerability-in-ios-macos/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_11.html">Google</a> have recently reported critical vulnerabilities in their systems&#8212;iOS and Chrome, respectively&#8212;that are ultimately the result of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/09/incomplete-disclosures-by-apple-and-google-create-huge-blindspot-for-0-day-hunters/">same vulnerability</a> in the libwebp library:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Thursday, researchers from security firm Rezillion published evidence that they said made it &#8220;highly likely&#8221; both indeed stemmed from the same bug, specifically in libwebp, the code library that apps, operating systems, and other code libraries incorporate to process WebP images.</p>
<p>Rather than Apple, Google, and Citizen Lab coordinating and accurately reporting the common origin of the vulnerability, they chose to use a separate CVE designation, the researchers said. The researchers concluded that &#8220;millions of different applications&#8221; would remain vulnerable until they, too, incorporated the libwebp fix. That, in turn, they said, was preventing automated systems that developers use to track known vulnerabilities in their offerings from detecting a critical vulnerability that&#8217;s under active exploitation...</p></blockquote>
