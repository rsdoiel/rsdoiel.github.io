2022-11-01T18:09:48-07:00	So I think I see how this works. I might actually grok twet :-)
2022-11-01T18:16:31-07:00	So now I need to figure out what list of twtxt I want to follow, then figure out how to integrate them something I can read in newsboat
2022-11-11T08:00:00-08:00	I like @davewiner's FeedLand,  yarn.social looks very promising. Simpler to integrate than activity pub. These days I'm hanging out on the small web at gopher://sdf.org:70/1/users/rsdoiel/ and  https://rsdoiel.github.io/twtxt.txt. ðŸ˜€

2022-11-11T20:30:40Z	(#gqlmwga) @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> If I have a twtxt.txt file on my static blog site at GitHub can I mirror that into me feed here? Or would it be better to pull this feed and update my blog's twtxt.txt file accordingly? Thank you

2022-11-11T21:05:40Z	Seem to be getting duplicates when I sync, I think I am still missing something in integrated Yarn/twtxt.net and my local text tools.

2022-11-14T19:27:50Z	(#2utweua) @<rsdoiel https://twtxt.net/user/rsdoiel/twtxt.txt> Ah, I see, yes's I suspect it's the URL in the metadata.  Let me fix that. Sorry for the delay response needed a break from the computer this weekend. Some times it is good to unplug :-)
2022-11-14T20:00:01Z	(#2utweua) Hmmm, I not understanding something. I'm pretty sure this is pilot error on my part.â€¨â€¨1. I changed the metadata (url =) in my github.com copy twtxt.txt to match the and ran `yarnc sync twtxt.txt` locally.  Still propagating duplicates (most duplicates have no hash)â€¨2. Replaced my local twtxt.txt file with contents of https://twtxt.net/user/rsdoiel/twtxt.txt, cleaned up duplicates, commit change to Github, ran `yarnc sync twtxt.txt`. Propogating  duplicates still.â€¨â€¨In the web UI of twtxt.net I don't see a "delete" button to remove duplicates. In the curled twtxt.txt file there is odd formatting. The text would wrap to a new line and occasionally this would run into one of the duplicate post's timestamps (i.e. no newline between previous post and next post). Garbage in garbage out maybe?
