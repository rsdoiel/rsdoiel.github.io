2022-10-31T14:25:43Z-0700	So now I understand the file format I need to setup following some twtxt sites
2022-11-01T18:09:48-07:00	So I think I see how this works. I might actually grok twet :-)
2022-11-01T18:16:31-07:00	So now I need to figure out what list of twtxt I want to follow, then figure out how to integrate them something I can read in newsboat
2022-11-11T08:00:00-08:00	I like @davewiner's FeedLand,  yarn.social looks very promising. Simpler to integrate than activity pub. These days I'm hanging out on the small web at gopher://sdf.org:70/1/users/rsdoiel/ and  https://rsdoiel.github.io/twtxt.txt. ðŸ˜€

2022-11-11T20:30:40Z	(#gqlmwga) @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> If I have a twtxt.txt file on my static blog site at GitHub can I mirror that into me feed here? Or would it be better to pull this feed and update my blog's twtxt.txt file accordingly? Thank you2022-11-01T18:09:48-07:00	So I think I see how this works. I might actually grok twet :-)

2022-11-11T20:35:20Z	(#gqlmwga) Thank you, still wrapping my head around all this.
