2022-11-01T18:09:48-07:00	(#l3ayasq) So I think I see how this works. I might actually grok twet :-)
2022-11-01T18:16:31-07:00	(#ucti2jq) So now I need to figure out what list of twtxt I want to follow, then figure out how to integrate them something I can read in newsboat
2022-11-11T08:00:00-08:00	(#x4elfaa) I like @davewiner's FeedLand, yarn.social looks very promising. Simpler to integrate than activity pub. These days I'm hanging out on the small web at gopher://sdf.org:70/1/users/rsdoiel/ and https://rsdoiel.github.io/twtxt.txt and https://twtxt.net/user/rsdoiel/. ðŸ˜€

2022-11-11T20:30:40Z	(#gqlmwga) @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> If I have a twtxt.txt file on my static blog site at GitHub can I mirror that into me feed here? Or would it be better to pull this feed and update my blog's twtxt.txt file accordingly? Thank you
2022-11-11T20:35:20Z	(#gqlmwga) Thank you, still wrapping my head around all this.
2022-11-12T01:44:20Z	(#zz5bkta) Thank you, glad it made some sense.  Writing for me is very challenging but sometimes fun.
2022-11-14T19:27:50Z	(#2utweua) @<rsdoiel https://twtxt.net/user/rsdoiel/twtxt.txt> Ah, I see, yes's I suspect it's the URL in the metadata.  Let me fix that. Sorry for the delay response needed a break from the computer this weekend. Some times it is good to unplug :-)

2022-11-11T21:05:40Z	Seem to be getting duplicates when I sync, I think I am still missing something in integrated Yarn/twtxt.net and my local text tools.
2022-11-14T19:27:50Z	(#2utweua) @<rsdoiel https://twtxt.net/user/rsdoiel/twtxt.txt> Ah, I see, yes's I suspect it's the URL in the metadata.  Let me fix that. Sorry for the delay response needed a break from the computer this weekend. Some times it is good to unplug :-)
2022-11-14T20:00:01Z	(#2utweua) Hmmm, I not understanding something. I'm pretty sure this is pilot error on my part.â€¨â€¨1. I changed the metadata (url =) in my github.com copy twtxt.txt to match the and ran `yarnc sync twtxt.txt` locally.  Still propagating duplicates (most duplicates have no hash)â€¨2. Replaced my local twtxt.txt file with contents of https://twtxt.net/user/rsdoiel/twtxt.txt, cleaned up duplicates, commit change to Github, ran `yarnc sync twtxt.txt`. Propogating  duplicates still.â€¨â€¨In the web UI of twtxt.net I don't see a "delete" button to remove duplicates. In the curled twtxt.txt file there is odd formatting. The text would wrap to a new line and occasionally this would run into one of the duplicate post's timestamps (i.e. no newline between previous post and next post). Garbage in garbage out maybe?
2022-11-14T20:12:35Z	(#2utweua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think you're making sense but my brain is dim ðŸ™‚
2022-11-15T01:30:01Z	(#2utweua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sorry had to finish my "day job" and missed. Time zones are so disruptive to communications.  I haven't used IRC in a few decades, need to remember how it works and where the client is. Feeling really old now. :-|
2022-11-16T00:59:07Z	(#nkrwwha) This is very cool.
2022-11-17T16:35:45Z	(#vium74a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> nice writeup. I've been thinking a bit about GPS logging again but had concerns. Also it was nice to use Gopher again ðŸ˜Ž
