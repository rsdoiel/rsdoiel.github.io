2022-11-01T18:09:48-07:00	So I think I see how this works. I might actually grok twet :-)
2022-11-01T18:16:31-07:00	So now I need to figure out what list of twtxt I want to follow, then figure out how to integrate them something I can read in newsboat
2022-11-11T08:00:00-08:00	I like @davewiner's FeedLand,  yarn.social looks very promising. Simpler to integrate than activity pub. These days I'm hanging out on the small web at gopher://sdf.org:70/1/users/rsdoiel/ and  https://rsdoiel.github.io/twtxt.txt. ðŸ˜€
2022-11-11T11:34:49-08:00	Blog post on [Twitter Implosion](https://rsdoiel.github.io/blog/2022/11/11/Twitter-implosion.html)

2022-11-11T20:30:40Z	(#gqlmwga) @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> If I have a twtxt.txt file on my static blog site at GitHub can I mirror that into me feed here? Or would it be better to pull this feed and update my blog's twtxt.txt file accordingly? Thank you

2022-11-11T20:35:20Z	(#gqlmwga) Thank you, still wrapping my head around all this.
2022-11-11T21:05:40Z	Seem to be getting duplicates when I sync, I think I am still missing something in integrated Yarn/twtxt.net and my local text tools.
2022-11-12T01:44:20Z	(#zz5bkta) Thank you, glad it made some sense.  Writing for me is very challenging but sometimes fun.
2022-11-14T19:27:50Z	(#2utweua) @<rsdoiel https://twtxt.net/user/rsdoiel/twtxt.txt> Ah, I see, yes's I suspect it's the URL in the metadata.  Let me fix that. Sorry for the delay response needed a break from the computer this weekend. Some times it is good to unplug :-)
