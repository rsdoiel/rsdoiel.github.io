# Turtles versus Squirrels

At my place of employment there is a pond. It is actually a nearly complete ecosystem. It includes the following animals and fish - turtles, carp, crayfish. Adjacent to the pond are a feral population of squirrels. The squirrels have their patrons as do the turtles.  But both will gladly eat most hand outs and will compete.  The turtles have adopted a strategy of mass exiting the lower pond almost as a platoon or military squad storming a beach. The squirrels strategy is less cooperative but equally effective.
