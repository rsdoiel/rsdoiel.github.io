The White House receives many inquiries and comments from Congress and the public.&#160; In today’s world, the President’s White House public engagement and communications staffs handle much of the work of responding to those missives.&#160; In the past, however, most of that work was farmed out to the various agencies in the Executive Branch.&#160; Inquiries &#8230; Continue reading White House Approbation, 1953

Perhaps the most consequential result of the tsunami of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/01/blockchain-gaslighting.html"><i>Blockchain Gaslighting</i></a> ocurred on 14<sup>th</sup> June 2018 when William Hinman, the Director of the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance gave a speech to the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto entitled <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418"><i>Digital Asset Transactions: When Howey Met Gary (Plastic)</i></a>. In it he hamstrung his own agency's ability to regulate the two most important cryptocurrencies by saying (my emphasis):<br />
<blockquote>
when I look at Bitcoin today, I do not see a central third party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. The network on which Bitcoin functions is operational and <b>appears to have been decentralized for some time, perhaps from inception</b>. Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value.[9] And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, <b>the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure</b>, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And, as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value. Over time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required.
</blockquote>
Follow me below the fold for both the evidence that Hinman was talking though his hat, and also yet another update on the theme of my <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/09/brief-remarks-to-iosco-defi-wg.html"><i>Brief Remarks to IOSCO DeFi WG</i></a>, that successful systems claiming to be decentralized, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, aren't.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
Hinman's speech was, as we shall see, ill-informed to say the least. The consequence of his abdication of responsibility was to provide an opening for the much smaller and much less powerful CFTC, which already approved trading in futures contracts on the notoriously manipulated cryptocurrency spot markets. Grabbing the chance to expand her agency's mandate, CFTC chair Rostin Banham later asserted that "<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/29/bitcoin-could-double-in-price-under-cftc-regulation-chairman-behnam-says/">Bitcoin might double in price if there’s a CFTC-regulated market</a>”. It isn't clear how the CFTC's mission migrated from protecting investors to pumping cryptocurrencies.<br />

It so happens that, <i>eleven days</i> after Hinman spoke, in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/07/special-report-on-decentralizing.html"><i>Special Report on Decentralizing the Internet</i></a>, I included a pie chart of the distribution of Bitcoin mining power showing that three mining pools controlled the Bitcoin blockchain. In a later post, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/12/blockchain-whats-not-to-like.html"><i>Blockchain: What's Not To Like?</i></a>, I included a pie chart showing that on 10<sup>th</sup> October that year three mining pools controlled the Ethereum blockchain.<br />
<br />
Not that in 2018 the centralization of these blockchains was news or hard to understand. That successful permissionless peer-to-peer systems inevitably centralize is a consequence of two observations, one from computer science and one from economics:<br />
<ol>
<li>The security of these systems depends upon defending against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Sybil attacks</a> by making participation more expensive than the reward from an attack. This had been well-known in computer science since well before the attack was named in 2002.</li>
<li>Technologies in general, and these systems in particular, have very strong economies of scale. This had been well-known in economics since well before W. Brian Arthur's 1994 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967"><i>Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy</i></a></li>
</ol>
Thus participation in these systems will have strong economies of scale, which will drive oligopoly, in other words centralization. I first detailed the process on 7<sup>th</sup> October 2014 in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/economies-of-scale-in-peer-to-peer.html"><i>Economies of Scale in Peer-to-Peer Networks</i></a>. It wasn't a prophesy; four months earlier Dan Goodin's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/06/bitcoin-security-guarantee-shattered-by-anonymous-miner-with-51-network-power/"><i>Bitcoin security guarantee shattered by anonymous miner with 51% network power</i></a> reported that:<br />
<blockquote>
on June 12, GHash produced a majority of the power for 12 hours straight,<br />
...<br />
GHash's ascendency to a majority miner comes even as its operators <a href="https://ghash.io/ghashio_press_release.pdf">pledged never to cross the 51-percent threshold</a>. It also comes less than a year after GHash was accused of <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=327767.0">using its considerable hashing power to attack a gambling site</a>. 
</blockquote>
Thus <i>four years and two days</i> before Hinman spoke, the centralization of the Bitcoin blockchain had become obvious even to the crypto-bros. The fact that the Ethereum blockchain had, by the time Hinman spoke, suffered at least as much centralization as Bitcoin's was by then equally well-known. Indeed, 17 months before Hinman spoke, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum stressed the fragility of decentralization in <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274"><i>The Meaning of Decentralization</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the case of blockchain protocols, the mathematical and economic reasoning behind the safety of the consensus often relies crucially on the uncoordinated choice model, or the assumption that the game consists of many small actors that make decisions independently.
</blockquote>
and pointed out the <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">lack of it in practice</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
can we really say that the uncoordinated choice model is realistic when 90% of the Bitcoin network’s mining power is well-coordinated enough to show up together at the same conference?
</blockquote>
Saying that Hinman was ill-informed about the technology he was refusing to regulate is an understatement.<br />
<br />
Why am I bringing up this history now, more than 5 years later? To point out that there has been no progress on resolving either the regulatory or the centralization problems.<br />
<br />
Nine-digit political contributions and lobbying from Sam Bankman-Fried and Ryan Salame failed to get regulatory authority assigned to the CFTC before the collapse of FTX made the idea radioactive. The SEC's enforcement actions have steered clear of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and now face <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-08-03/terra-is-usually-a-security">incompatible rulings</a> from Judge Analisa Torres in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-03/sec-bid-for-quick-appeal-of-crypto-ruling-is-denied-by-judge?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2">Ripple case</a> versus Judge Jed Rakoff in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/ripple-ruling-on-crypto-rejected-by-federal-judge-in-terra-case?sref=1kJVNqnU">Terra case</a>.<br />
<br />
But the proximate cause of this post was Olga Kharif's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-30/ethereum-eth-concentration-grows-after-key-relay-provider-drops-out"><i>Ethereum Is Becoming More Concentrated After a Key Infrastructure Provider Dropped Out</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On Sept. 27, blockchain infrastructure provider Blocknative said it will stop operating as a so-called relay, a key participant in adding blocks of transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. Its exit leaves only four other major relay players to handle most Ethereum blocks and raises concern of potential problems, ranging from the censorship of transactions to stealing of other key operators’ profits.<br />
<br />
The relay issue comes as Ethereum already faces concentration concerns in other parts of its operations. The network is run jointly by relays as well as parties called builders, which compile most transactions into blocks, and validators, which order blocks into a blockchain. Both builder and validator functions are dominated by a handful of participants. The relay decline is especially worrisome.<br />
...<br />
The situation goes against the decentralized ethos of crypto, which was born in the fallout of the Global Financial Crisis as a reaction against powers that be: corporate and government control.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-30/ethereum-eth-concentration-grows-after-key-relay-provider-drops-out">Kharif notes that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
  The builder category is highly centralized, also. While a year ago one builder — Flashbots — controlled the market, nowadays four builders, including one run by crypto market maker Wintermute, account for the majority of blocks built, according to Relayscan.io.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-30/ethereum-eth-concentration-grows-after-key-relay-provider-drops-out">And</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
  To add to the problems, a pool called Lido currently controls 32.3% of total validator power. A validator controlling 34% could potentially falsify transactions.
</blockquote>
It is worth repeating that, just like Bitcoin's, Ethereum's blockchain has never been really decentralized. Even more "against the decentralized ethos of crypto" is the fact that, as <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">Moxie Marlinspike documented</a>, most "smart contracts" on Ethereum use one of two services, Infura and Alchemy. On the 1<sup>st</sup> January 2019 <i>The Block</i> published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190114224145/https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/01/10/the-burden-of-infura/"><i>The Burden of Infura</i></a>, which started:<br />
<blockquote>
Infura (hosted on AWS) is positioned as a potential single central point of failure for a significant portion of the Ethereum network in its current form, as its infrastructure dependence is widely pervasive within the dapp ecosystem
</blockquote>
Ethereum's switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake clearly hasn't reduced centralization, because the fundamental problem isn't technical, it is economic. 
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-30/ethereum-eth-concentration-grows-after-key-relay-provider-drops-out">Kharif writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Currently, relays have little financial incentives to act, and many are simply there because they want to support the network or have side businesses that can benefit from offering the function. It costs $500,000 to $1 million a year to operate a relay, Klarman said, and relays don’t get paid. While several ways to compensate relays have been considered in the past year — since Ethereum moved to its new proof-of-stake system of ordering transactions that uses relays, builders and validators — none has taken off.
</blockquote>
I have often complimented the Ethereum team's technical and operational skills; the Merge was an extraordinary success along both axes. But their devotion to Austrian economics means that they aren't good at designing economic systems. Here, for example, they designed a clever piece of technical infrastructure that needed many instances if the system were to be "sufficiently decentralized". Running an instance cost "$500,000 to $1 million a year", so there were never going to be that many of them, and the designers forgot to provide the few instances that there were with any, let alone a viable, business model. It is really amazing that, after 8 years running a system in which economics forced centralization of its infrastructure, Ethereum failed to address the economic problems of its infrastructure.<br />
<br />
The failure is actually quite understandable because the problem is fundamental. As I wrote in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/03/more-cryptocurrency-gaslighting.html"><i>More Cryptocurrency Gaslighting</i></a> what investors need is an investment:<br />
<blockquote>
Proof-of-Stake has the same fundamental problem of gambling vs. investment. As I write 17.6M ETH have been staked. With a block time of 12s, each ETH can expect a reward on average once in 6.7 years (gambling). So the "nodes" in the Ethereum network are not individuals running their own validators, but staking services such as Lido, and exchanges staking their customers' coins such as Coinbase and Kraken. Each of these nodes stakes millions of ETH (investment).
</blockquote>
It seems the crypto-bros don't need decentralization and trustlessness in practice, they only need it in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3326244">Prof Angela Walch's words</a> as "a veil that covers over and prevents many from seeing the actions of key actors within the system".

## Analysts: Congressional Budget Battle Gives Beijing Opening in the Pacific

date: 2023-10-10

When Congress passed temporary funding for the U.S. government at the end of September, it left out economic assistance for two small Pacific nations that U.S. defense officials say are critical to Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy and are targets of China’s aggressive influence campaign.

Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands control a large swath of the Pacific Ocean. Under a special agreement known as the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA, these three nations give Washington the right to deny access to other nations — including China — in exchange for American economic assistance.

But when funding for the compact expired on September 30, Palau and the Marshall Islands received no new economic assistance under the continuing resolution that kept the U.S. government open for 45 days.

“We have to draw a line somewhere,” argued Dave Stilwell, former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, in an interview. “If the spirit of the compact[s] is to continue, it has to start with some limits on how the funds are spent, particularly on technology for data transfer.”

Cleo Paskal, a nonresident senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, disagreed.

“Effectively, the [continuing resolution] leaves the Marshalls high and dry,” she told VOA.

Paskal said the funding shortfall is most acute in the case of Palau, which stands to receive $90 million if and when Congress approves an extension of its compact for 2024, documents show. The country ran a deficit of at least $37 million on a total budget of less than $150 million in fiscal year 2021, according to Palau government documents.

“Now, because the CR [doesn’t advance temporary funding to Palau], Palau’s debt continues, and it’s going to have to get into more debt,” said Paskal.

By contrast, Micronesia received more than $16 million in the continuing resolution, according to a U.S. official who spoke on background because he was not authorized to speak for the administration.

Paskal says the uneven treatment is a mistake for U.S. national security.

“We need that corridor of freedom that stretches from Hawaii to Philippines,” she said, “It’s how you get to the treaty allies, how you get to Taiwan.”

Under the compacts, the Biden administration has proposed spending $7.1 billion over the next 20 years to provide education, health care and environmental assistance to these island nations.

But while negotiations with Micronesia and Palau have been completed, the Marshall Islands is still in talks. Lawmakers expect to vote on the long-term funding once all agreements are signed.

“For a relatively low investment, [this] can have high impact,” said Jim Loi, chief operating officer at the Asia Group.

“This, by U.S. government budget standards, is nothing. It is literally a half day’s worth of Medicare fraud,” said Grant Newsham, a former diplomat and U.S. marine intelligence officer, in an interview.

Newsham calculates that Washington is actually saving money over the long term by signing compacts with these Pacific nations.

He said it would cost the U.S. at least $100 billion to purchase the ships, aircraft, submarines, missiles and troops needed to secure the 5.6 million square kilometers of Pacific Ocean controlled by these tiny island nations.

Loi warned that Beijing is actively seeking to exploit any doubts about U.S. commitment to the region. “I think we would expect that the Chinese are going to push and so now would not be the time for us to turn a blind eye,” he said.

Newsham is particularly concerned about Palau, which is in not only in debt but under constant economic pressure from Beijing, which shut down Chinese tourism to Palau in retaliation for its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.

“They’re counting on the United States. They want to be a good ally, a good friend,” he said, “and we aren’t coming through with what they need.”

## Pluralistic: Underground Empire; The Lost Cause prologue part IV (10 Oct 2023)

date: 2023-10-10

Today's links Underground Empire: Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman's must-read account of "How America Weaponized the World Economy." The Lost Cause prologue part IV: "Commies, agitators, traitors, and climate bed wetters." Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Underground Empire (permalink) At the end of Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman's new book Underground Empire, they cite the work of John Lewis Gaddis, "preeminent historian of the Cold War," who dubbed that perilous period "The Long Peace": https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250840554/undergroundempire[1] Despite several harrowing near-misses, neither of the two hair-trigger, nuclear-tipped arsenals were ever loosed. When the Cold War ended, the world breathed a sigh of relief and set about refashioning itself, braiding together economic and social interdependencies that were supposed to make future war unthinkable. Nations that depend on one another couldn't afford to go to war, because they couldn't hurt the other without hurting themselves. The standard account of the Cold War's "Long Peace" is that the game theorists who invented Mutually Assured Destruction set up a game where "the only way to win was not to play" (to quote the Matthew Broderick documentary War Games). The interdependency strategy of the post-Cold War, neoliberal, "flat" world was built on the same fundamentals: make war more costly than peace, victory worse than the status quo, and war would be over &#8211; if we wanted it. But Gaddis has a different idea. Any effect Mutually Assured Destruction had on keeping fingers from pushing the buttons was downstream of a much more important factor: independence. For the most part, the US and the USSR had nonintersecting spheres of influence. Each of these spheres was self-sufficient. That meant that they didn't compete with one another for the use of the same resource or territory, and neither could put the other in check by seizing some asset they both relied on. The exceptions to this &#8211; proxy wars in Latin America and Southeast Asia &#8211; were the disastrous exceptions that proved the rule. But the past forty years rejected this theory. From Thomas Friedman's "World Is Flat" to Fukyama's "End of History," the modern road to peace is paved with networks whose nodes can be found in every country. These networks &#8211; shipping routes, money-clearing systems, supply chains, the internet itself &#8211; weave together nearly every nation on Earth into a single web of interdependencies that make war impossible. War, you may have noticed, has become very, very possible. Even countries with their own McDonald's franchises are willing to take up arms against one another. That's where Farrell and Newman's book comes in. The two political scientists tell the story of how these global networks were built through accidents of history, mostly by American corporations and/or the American state. The web was built by accident, but the spider at its center was always the USA. At various junctures since the Cold War, American presidents, spies and military leaders have noticed this web and tugged at it. A tariff here, a sanction there, then an embargo. The NSA turns the internet into a surveillance grid and a weapon of war. The SWIFT system is turned into a way to project American political goals around the world &#8211; first by blocking transactions for things the US government disfavors, then to cut off access for people who do business with people who do things that the US wants stopped. Networks tend to centralization, to hubs. These central points are efficient, but (as we learned during the covid lockdown) brittle. One factory fails and an entire category of goods can no longer be made &#8211; anywhere. When it comes to global resiliency, these bottlenecks are are a bug; but when it comes to US foreign policy, these chokepoints are a feature. Farrell and Newman skillfully weave a tale of individuals, powers, circumstances and forces, showing how the rise and rise of world-is-flat rah-rah globalism created a series of irresistable opportunities for "weaponized interdependence." Some players of the game wield these weapons like a scalpel; others (like Trump) use them like a club. This is a chronicle of the dawning realization &#8211; among US power-players and their foreign adversaries, particularly in China &#8211; that the US lured its trading partners into entrusting it with financial clearing, IP enforcement, fiber landings, and other chokepoints, on the grounds that American wouldn't risk the wealth these systems generated by turning them into engines of coercion. But then, of course, that's exactly what America did, from the War on Terror to economic sanctions on Iran, from seizing Argentinian reserves to freezing Russia's cash. Sometimes, the US did this for reasons that I sympathize with, other times, for reasons I am aghast at. But they did it, and did it, and did it. America's adversaries (and frenemies, like the EU) have tried to build alternative "underground empires" to offset the risk of having their interdependencies weaponized (or to escape from an ongoing situation). But therein lies a conundrum: world-is-flat-ism has ended the age of indepedence. Countries really do need each other &#8211; for energy, materials, and finished goods. Independence is a long way off. To create new interdependency networks, it's not enough for countries to agree that they don't trust America as neutral maintainer of their strategic chokepoints. They also have to agree to trust one of their own to operate those chokepoints. Lots of countries have come to mistrust US dollar-clearing and the SWIFT system &#8211; but few are willing to allow, say, China to run an alternative system that carries out settlements in Renminbi. The EU might be able to suck in some "friendly" countries for a Euro-clearing system, but would China trust them? How about Iran? Farrell and Newman make a good case that US's position at the center of the web is a historical accident, and possibly a one-off, contingent on the ascendant post-Cold War ideology that said that markets and the interdependencies they create would neutralize the threat of handing a rival nation that much power. Which leaves us in a world of interdependency in conflict. If Gaddis is right and the Long Peace was the result of independence, then this bodes very ill. The only thing worse than a world where no one can depend on anyone is a world where we must depend on entities that are hostile to us, and vice-versa. That way lies a widening gyre of conflict that felt eerily palpable as world events unfolded while I read this excellent, incisive book. Political science, done right, has the power to reframe your whole understanding of events around you. Farrell and Newman set out a compelling thesis, defend it well, and tell a fascinating tale. And when they finish, they leave you with a way to make sense of things that seem senseless and terrible. This may not make those things less terrible, but at least they're comprehensible. The Lost Cause prologue part IV (permalink) My next novel is The Lost Cause, a rollicking solarpunk adventure about defending the Green New Deal from seagoing anarcho-capitalist wreckers and white nationalist militias; Bill McKibben called it "a chronicle of mutual aid that is politically perceptive, scientifically sound, and extraordinarily hopeful": The book comes out on Nov 14 from Tor Books and Head of Zeus, and I'm running a Kickstarter campaign to pre-sell the ebook, hardcover and (especially) the audiobook (Amazon refuses to carry my audiobooks, so this is the only way to get them into readers' hands); you can back it now: http://lost-cause.org[2] To whet your appetite, I'm serializing the book's prologue, which really kicks things off: Here's part one: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/06/green-new-deal-fic/#the-first-generation-in-a-century-not-to-fear-the-future[3] And part two: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/07/met-cute-ugly/#part-ii[4] And part three: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/09/working-the-refs/#lost-cause-prologue[5] And now, part four: * * * A couple of my friends were working on an AP science project—­ they’d made an enzyme they thought would break down polyethylene at room temperature—­and I’d promised that I’d help them after school. Walking home past Verdugo Park, I ran into some more friends sitting in the grass and chatting, so I sat with them, watching the kids on the playground and the dog-­walkers and the swordfighting class boffing each other with foam swords, and hours slipped by. By the time I headed home, the sun was low and the day was finally starting to cool off. I remembered that I’d forgotten to pull the blinds before going out and imagined how hot and stuffy the house would be. Maybe Gramps had gotten back early enough to lower them. Otherwise, I could lie in the backyard in my hammock and do some reading while I waited for the house to air out some. The blinds were drawn. I went in through the back door and dropped my bag on my bed, stripped off my tee and pulled on a fresh one, and headed to the kitchen for a snack. “Gramps?” He didn’t answer, which I figured meant that he was playing his podcasts through his hearing aids. They were supposed to be smart enough to pass speech through, but they struggled with people shouting from other rooms. I grabbed some more iced coffee and went into the living room. Gramps was sitting in his spot on the old sofa, staring out the window. “Gramps?” He didn’t look around. I moved into his line of sight and then drew back. His face was set in a mask of rage I hadn’t seen since I was a kid and came to live with him, the face he’d make before he’d hit me. He hadn’t hit me in a long time, not since he’d raised a bruise where one of my middle-­school teachers could see it and she’d called CPS on him. They’d made him do a month of mandatory anger-­management classes. “Gramps?” I reached for him but didn’t touch him. He was quivering. He fixed his gaze on me. Glared. “What’s wrong? Are you okay?” He stood up. He was shorter than me now, and couldn’t quite straighten up, but it still felt like he was towering over me. “Kid, you know exactly what’s wrong, and don’t pretend otherwise.” Oh. “Gramps, he could have killed me. I saved his life. I know he’s a friend of yours—­” “Shut the fuck up about that, kid. Don’t talk about my friends. Don’t talk about who I know and who I don’t know. You know what that dumb asshole Mike Kennedy is up against? Forty years. Seven felony counts. Most of ’em to do with you: kidnapping, assault, attempted murder. Death penalty shit. Don’t think that the DA isn’t going to use that, the feds have got a hard-­on for anyone who doesn’t toe the line on their Green New Deal bullshit. They’re gonna tell him that either he testifies against his friends or he’ll get a lethal injection. Kennedy’s no genius, either. He’ll cave. You just watch.” “Gramps—­” “Shut up, I said. You think saying my name on your viral video is gonna help anything. Shit, kid, why didn’t you just turn me in yourself?” “Come on, Gramps. I didn’t plan this, Mike did.” I wanted so badly to leave, but Gramps was between me and the door. “Tell you what, let’s go visit him. They’ll let him have visitors in lockup, right?” Gramps sagged back down into his chair. “Kennedy’s not in lockup. They let him go an hour ago.” “Oh,” I said. “Well, that sounds good, right?” He shook his head and gave me a disgusted look. “No, kid, that doesn’t sound good. That sounds like he ratted everyone out already. In which case he’s a fucking dead man.” I took a deep breath. Gramps was clearly on the brink of losing it altogether and telling him he was being overly dramatic would definitely push him right over the edge. “If that’s true, then maybe you should talk to your other friends, or maybe him—­” “Just shut up, okay? Don’t talk about shit you don’t and can’t understand. Look, if Kennedy sold out his friends then he’s got what’s coming to him and besides, there isn’t a damned thing in the world I could do to stop it. But what’s more likely is that he didn’t say a word, but they’ve put him on the street so that people get the impression that maybe he did, and now he’s in fear for his life and the only way to save his skin is to run back to the station house and start talking. It wouldn’t be the first time they tried that stunt. And the fact is, it doesn’t matter which one it is because he’s gonna get shut up before he can do that, because everyone understands what’s going on here and what’s at stake. So me calling that sad sack now would just make me the last person who spoke to the victim before he turned up dead.” “That’s terrible.” “No, kid, that’s life. What’s terrible is that my own grandson is involved in this ugly stupid mess, and that every dumbass on the internet is trading clips with my name in them, doxing me, associating me with this ridiculous garbage.” Now I was starting to get mad. “I didn’t do it on purpose, you know. Your friend threatened to kill me. I didn’t tell him to get up on that roof or fill his Super Soaker with hydrochloric acid.” “Yeah, you didn’t, that’s true.” He picked up a beer from the table next to him, finished the last swallow, set it down. “You didn’t. But you were and you did and now—­” He shook his empty beer. “Ah, shit. Brooks, listen, you know that my friends are okay, but some of their friends . . .” I knew. I’d sometimes spot Gramps’s friends marching with the Maga Club groups, carrying ugly signs, conspiracies and racism and “demographics are destiny.” Or set up with a table on Magnolia on Food Truck Friday, showing videos about “the great replacement” and “socialist tyranny.” “I know who you mean.” “None of ’em ever liked you. They didn’t like your father even before he went to Canada with that woman. When he did, well, that sealed it for ’em. To leave America and go work for the socialists? Kid, it’s a good thing he never tried to come back here, I’ll tell you that much. Far as they’re concerned, the only good thing that rabbit flu did was kill a bunch of foreign commies, agitators, traitors, and climate bed wetters. By which they mean your father and mother. And by extension, that means you. Your sex thing doesn’t help either—­” My head filled with that buzzing sound I heard whenever Gramps tried to talk to me about sexuality. The fact that I wouldn’t call myself straight made him crazy. The fact that I wouldn’t say “gay” or “bi” or any of those old-­fashioned terms made him absolutely bugfuck. “Queer” was okay with me, or “pan,” but honestly, who the fuck cared? Why would my grandfather need to know which people I wanted to fuck and which people I did fuck? I’d explained this to him calmly and I’d had shouting matches with him about it. My other friends had problems with this stuff, sure, but their parents were able to at least pretend to understand. Gramps was a generation older and not only didn’t he understand, he didn’t want to. “Just pick one, kid,” is what he’d say, and then I’d overhear him saying worse to his friends when they took over the kitchen to play poker or the living room to watch a game. “Jesus, Gramps”—­that buzzing sound was blood, of course, coursing in my ears as my rage built and built—­“would you just shut up about that bullshit? I don’t care what your asshole friends want. In case you didn’t notice, one of them nearly murdered me last night—­” “Shut. Up.” Loud, in that boss voice he used when he was getting everyone else to listen to him, whether it was on a jobsite or during an argument over cards. “Yeah, one of my friends just about murdered you last night, but he didn’t, did he? You know why? Because of me. Because of who I am in this community. Our name, Palazzo, it goes back a long way in this town. We’re Lockheed originals, thanks to my own dad. That counts for something. You’re safe because you’re my grandson, that’s what I’m trying to explain to you. But it’s not a get-­out-­of-­jail-­free card. You’re not untouchable.” “Thanks for letting me know.” I hated it when Gramps acted like he was in the Mafia because he and his friends were the kinds of assholes who periodically got drunk or disturbed enough to commit some act of idiotic vandalism. “Kid—­” he started. I left.

## How can I make a fruit crumble more exciting? | Kitchen aide

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<p>Crumbles are easy and delicious, but if you ever tire of the same old flavour pairings, our panel of expert cooks recommends branching out with nuts, spices and different types of flour</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>I love crumbles, but mine are always so basic. Is there a way to make them more exciting?<br></strong><em><strong>Jenny, Cardiff</strong></em><br>Crumbles are the easygoing friend of the dessert world; they welcome all (fruits, nuts, spices, chocolate), are simple to rustle up, and they’re as happy dressed up as they are down. The real magic, however, lies in “that squidgy layer between the fruit and crumble”, says ex-River Cafe <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anna.atthetable/?hl=en">pastry chef Anna Higham</a>, who opens <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quince.bakery/?hl=en-gb">Quince bakery</a> in London this autumn. Once that’s cracked – the winning formula is “lots of [fruit] juices and enough crumble to soak it up” – there are all manner of ways to up your crumble game.</p><p>“Crumbles are quite soft, so I’m a big fan of texture in the topping,” says Matt Adlard, author of <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/bake-it-better/matt-adlard/9780744064902">Bake it Better</a>. Nuts do the job nicely: hazelnuts roasted “to get a really toasty, nutty flavour”, say, or mix things up with a combination of two or three varieties.

## Why do we make the same mistakes as our parents?

<p>It’s impossible never to get angry or upset with our offspring – but we can all benefit by asking ourselves why we were triggered and if our responses were learned during our own childhood</p><p>Instinctively, we know that a child needs warmth and acceptance, physical touch, our physical presence. There must be love plus boundaries, understanding and validation, play with people of all ages, many experiences of being soothed when they’re upset and a lot of attention and time.

## Zadie Smith hats, Fellini tops: the rise of litcore

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<p>Cerebral types are wearing their literary and cinematic pretensions on their sleeves, quite literally</p><p>The hottest baseball caps in New York don’t sport the names of its sports franchises or even its streetwear brands. ZADIE SMITH, JOYCE CAROL OATES, ALICE MUNRO – these are the names emblazoned across caps made by the Montreal-based Minor Canon which, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/style/literary-hats-minor-canon.html">the New York Times reported</a>, is a small “fan project” that sells merchandise related to reading and publishing. Also included in the range of $27 caps “celebrating” female authors are Deborah Levy, Chris Kraus and Mary Gaitskill. Or at least they were, until the shop’s founder, Saelan Twerdy, pulled the collection. He had not asked the authors for permission to use their names, which angered fans, who called the venture exploitative.</p><p>Exploitative, perhaps, of a larger trend: consuming culture as a performative act. People have always worn slogan T-shirts to look cool, but never has apparel been quite so focused on highbrow arts attire: indie films and literary fiction rather than buzz bands or streetwear labels. It’s the rise of the bookishnista, who wears their literary, cinematic, or intellectual pretensions literally on their sleeve (or, as the case may be for Minor Canon, on their head). These tenurecore, literary-fairy kids identify as people who appreciate culture in an elevated, non-basic way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/oct/10/books-film-fashion-literary">Continue reading...</a>

## The Miracle Club review – Maggie Smith can’t save this rocky road trip to Lourdes

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<p>Laura Linney is upstaged by older co-stars Smith and Kathy Bates in this sentimental tale about a group of Dublin women who go on a spiritual journey together</p><p>Who’s up for a golden-hued heartwarmer set in 60s Ireland starring Kathy Bates and Maggie Smith about women with secret fears and dreams going on a church trip to Lourdes and finally finding the real miracle is their new compassion for each other? The answer to this question could well have been … me. I have a liking for a gentle tale and there is nothing necessarily wrong with, just occasionally, showing Ireland and the church of this period with something other than outrage and horror. But The Miracle Club does not at any time, to use a discredited metaphor, throw away its crutches and walk. And it’s painful to note that this is largely because of the way film can’t convincingly use that estimable actor Laura Linney in a central role. She is upstaged by the older, fruitier performances and doesn’t hold her own with a more serious persona.</p><p>In a tough district of Dublin, four women each have reasons for going on a trip to Lourdes. Tough-as-nails Eileen Dunne (Bates) is worried about the lump she has found in her breast, but would rather go to Lourdes than see a doctor; her shiftless husband Frank (Stephen Rea) wonders grumpily who is going to cook his supper. Maggie Smith is Lily Fox, a woman with a small disability in her leg, but whose reasons for going to Lourdes are more to do with her spiritual pain at the loss of her son. Twentysomething Dolly Hennessy (Agnes O’Casey) is going to bring along her little boy who for some reason will not speak. All find that their menfolk are obstructive about wives going to Lourdes or indeed doing anything independent whatsoever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/10/the-miracle-club-review-maggie-smith-laura-linney-kathy-bates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>So-called “prime age” workers — those 25 to 54 — are working jobs at a higher rate than before the pandemic. But the picture gets more complicated for older workers.

## ActivityPub?

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<p>There's been some recent discussion about whether ActivityPub is the standard everyone should be building on, and that new ways of social networking, or even previously existing ones, should stop and implement ActivityPub.</p>
<p>My answer is this -- if ActivityPub were sufficient, I'd say yes -- let's coalesce around one standard, and stop trying to make something slightly better. I have a motto that goes with this -- One way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. For a couple of reasons: 1. You still have to support both, so you just made everyone's life more complicated, assuming the second way gains traction. 2. The goal is interop, not creating standards. Both of these are part of my <a href="https://this.how/standards/">Rules for Standards-makers</a>. </p>
<p>But honestly, ActivityPub is both insufficient and a mess. And I'm not even convinced that what it's doing is all that worthwhile. I don't see conversation on social nets as having much value. Replies to my posts tend to be spam, people looking for exposure, hitching a ride on a post that's getting some flow, or to be annoying. It's very rare that new ideas or information come to light this way. </p>
<p>And all the arguing in the world won't change the way things are going. ActivityPub isn't the standard. People want to be Mastodon-compatible, not ActivityPub-compatible. Much of what Mastodon is doing isn't part of ActivityPub, it's their own API. </p>
<p>I've seen it said that Atom was a good thing, that somehow <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> wasn't enough. And all the "IndieWeb" protocols that just reinvent the <a href="http://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog">Metaweblog API</a>. Depends what your goals were. If you were intending to keep RSS and the blogging APIs from growing, then they were great successes. People spent time judging not aiming for more interop, whether items had their proper names, which is a common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution_(biology)">devolution</a> in this kind of work, they even have a name for it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">bike-shedding</a>. </p>
<p>It's better to reduce the number of competing formats than to increase the number. </p>
<p>Again all that matters is interop, and splitting an open standard into multiple competing standards works <i>against</i> interop.</p>
<p>Back to ActivityPub. I wish it were simpler, that you could get something interesting working quickly that delivers interop. But it isn't that way, and no one seems interested in making it so. So imho the world will not coalesce behind ActivityPub, I wish it could, but it can't and won't happen. </p>
```

## Model Extraction Attack on Neural Networks

date: 2023-10-09

```html
<p>Adi Shamir et al. have a new <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1526.pdf">model extraction attack</a> on neural networks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Polynomial Time Cryptanalytic Extraction of Neural Network Models</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Billions of dollars and countless GPU hours are currently spent on training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for a variety of tasks. Thus, it is essential to determine the difficulty of extracting all the parameters of such neural networks when given access to their black-box implementations. Many versions of this problem have been studied over the last 30 years, and the best current attack on ReLU-based deep neural networks was presented at Crypto&#8217;20 by Carlini, Jagielski, and Mironov. It resembles a differential chosen plaintext attack on a cryptosystem, which has a secret key embedded in its black-box implementation and requires a polynomial number of queries but an exponential amount of time (as a function of the number of neurons)...</p></blockquote>

## Segregation’s toxic past re-emerges in North Carolina’s lead-poisoned playgrounds

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<p>Lead was found in several parks in Durham, North Carolina, a legacy of industrial waste in the city’s Black neighborhoods – and worsening segregation doesn’t help</p><p>Buck Blue fondly remembers growing up in Walltown, a tight-knit Black community in Durham, North Carolina, in the 1960s and 1970s. He would be out all day, playing football and basketball with buddies at the park near his house. They’d spend hours in the creek there, which turned different hues depending on a nearby textile mill’s dyeing work. They’d hang out in the tunnel that ferried the water across the road: “That was our clubhouse,” he said.</p><p>But his memories have been tainted. Last year, Duke University researchers <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/epdf/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00488">found</a> that some of the soil in Walltown Park, including sediment along the creek’s banks, is contaminated with lead. It’s a lingering remnant of the property’s days as a waste incinerator from around 1920 to 1942, one of five that the city operated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/10/durham-north-carolina-lead-playgrounds-black-neighborhoods">Continue reading...</a>

## Different forms of exchange

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<h1>Different forms of exchange</h1>
```

```html
<blockquote>
<p>Today is October 10. On the tenth day of every month, my wife and I
kiss and wish each other well, grateful for our ongoing relationship
counting the months and years we’ve been together. 31 years and 7
months! Our love remains an incredible source of joy and amazement
in my life.</p>
</blockquote>
```

```html
<p>Last year I was exchanging emails with <a class="account" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Greta" title="@Greta@fosstodon.org" rel="nofollow">@Greta</a>, author of
<a href="https://gretzuni.com/" rel="nofollow">Gretzuni</a>, her wiki-like digital garden. There,
she had written about the contributive economy in
<a href="https://gretzuni.com/articles/value-for-value" rel="nofollow">value for value</a>:</p>
```

```html
<blockquote>
<p>Bernard Stiegler championed the notion of a “contributive economy” —
in which everyone can be a contributor, emitting their own symbols.
In his economy of contribution, people are so much more than consumers.</p>
</blockquote>
```

```html
<p>So we started talking about systems of exchange. Do you see
contributions made in your free time as deserving of compensation? And
if so, in what form?</p>
```

```html
<p>I was surely influenced by my thoughts on
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2020-02-14_Unprofessional" rel="nofollow">staying unprofessional</a>.
In the context of role-playing games, I wrote:</p>
```

```html
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, consider how the act of playing our beloved games is
fundamentally anti-capitalistic: you don’t need to buy much of
anything to play. Pen, paper, dice, maybe a book or two. And then:
no money required for years and years. You can’t grow a global reach
by playing at a table. I guess you can grow a global audience with
YouTube and Twitch and all that, and maybe monetise it, but mostly
the providers of these services are going to monetise you. The
actual game needs no money. You talk and laugh, and scribble and
dabble, howl and haggle, and a good time is had. There is no
“growth.” There is no “increased productivity.” It’s about the basic
joys of being alive: talking to people, imagining things and telling
others about it.</p>
</blockquote>
```

```html
<p>So what about all the unpaid maintainers of software, the unpaid
maintainers of small websites? I usually love doing the things I do.
Sure, I hate bugs, and services failing, and migration hassles and
system upgrades and many more things besides. But in general, I spend
time at the laptop, programming, and time passes and I’m in a flow
state that I enjoy very much. Inner peace!</p>
```

```html
<p>At the time, Greta asked about small, everyday changes we can make to
support different forms of exchange. I wonder why this makes me
uncomfortable. Perhaps it’s the word “exchange” – and having read a
bit of “Debt” by Graeber – the suspicion is that exchange leads to
debt and accounting and that, I suspect, leads to a world that does
not run with “from each according to his ability, to each according to
his needs.” The word “exchange” conjures up a world of value-for-value
exchanges in which those that are smarter generate more value, and
also get back more value. And we already know from our current large
scale experiment of hacker culture, that meritocracy does not lead to
a better world. I mean, at least it’s not very corrupt, but there are
side effects like being a good hacker gaining you a good position
somewhere (meritocracy), and the good position gaining you visibility
and clout in other areas. It’s a bit like asking pop stars for their
opinions about a political topic: their abilities do not transfer, and
yet our world demonstrates that humans imagine the transfer. Maybe
something Kahn’s book on slow and fast thinking could illuminate this,
but I’ve only read the first part of it.</p>
```

```html
<p>So if small gains of reputation are susceptible to corruption in that
meritocracy and fame leads to abuses of authority, what about
gamification? When people used gamification on Stack Exchange, it sort
of worked. I find many of my questions answered, there. But at the
same time, people tell me that there are some who ask or answer inane
and trivial questions in order to rack up points, gaming the system
for side-effects. I’d say: every system of gamification will be gamed…
😆</p>
```

```html
<p>To bring it back to the everyday changes, and how to structure
environments – all I have is a bunch of hazy notions, nothing really
ready to go, but perhaps a start:</p>
```

```html
<p>It’s nice if you get recognition and praise, but this doesn’t have to
scale. In the giving-away Facebook group my wife is in, people are
offering so many things that your offers scroll off the bottom
quickly, and when you then give something away to somebody else, your
audience is small: the people that participated in the thread,
usually. On social media, you can always get more followers, there is
no sand in the machinery to slow you down. On the contrary, as more
and more followers boost your messages, more people start following
you. I unlisted myself from directories of accounts to follow because
I don’t need more followers. The number of followers can be
intimidating, or respect-inducing, and that’s not great, as far as I
am concerned.</p>
```

```html
<p>It’s nice if you can put your name to your work, but it’s also nice if
it’s possible and the default expectation for that association to
disappear over time. On a wiki, for example, your contributions can be
reworked, paraphrased, removed, and perhaps, for licensing reasons,
the name you provided is still going to be listed, but the exact
contributions your made are going to be lost (in the “kept pages”
sense that expire eventually). This is not about privacy, and the
ability to repudiate your contributions – those would be additional
benefits, which is why “forgetting in software” remains an interesting
topic to me. Oddmuse implements many of the things I could think of,
but more thought is required in the area, I think. In a way, IRC and
other such chat networks afford this, too: even if all the
interactions are logged forever (boo! hiss! bad for privacy and no
repudiation of your contributions…) the structure works against the
use of logs to build reputation and influence as the conversation
happens within IRC clients that typically do not show log information.
You cannot tell from a nick how many questions they asked, how many
likes and thanks they received, and so on – you might only get the
nick registration date, so: “age”.</p>
```

```html
<p>I also like frameworks where I can quickly and easily contribute small
things, like fixing typos in documentation. Sometimes this is made
possible via GitHub’s web interface where I can edit a document source
file, typically some Markdown file, and fix something, without having
to check out the project to my laptop, and doing the full dance.
Sadly, this is sometimes made impossible because documents don’t
typically show where the sources are, or the sources are in a system
where I don’t have an account, so I need to create an account, and if
there’s no web interface, I need to be ready to check out sources and
do the full dance. A wiki, in this respect, is great: the sources are
right there, the edit interface is right there, and my choice of
anonymity or pseudonymity is immediately available. A wiki could be
even greater if you could just edit the page directly. Interestingly,
while it is possible to setup Oddmuse such that it uses HTML only,
with an HTML editor, and edit on a double click on the page, I’ve
never actually used such a system myself. I guess I like the
separation into source document (wiki text, Markdown, and so on) and
result (HTML).</p>
```

```html
<p>Now that I’ve switched from Oddmuse to Oddµ for my personal wiki, I
haven’t handed out any accounts. And already Björn told me about a
type and pointed out that I had to fix it myself since he was no
longer able to edit the page. The irony is not lost on me.</p>
```

```html
<p>So this is where I am regarding small exchanges. I think the main
takeaway is that reputation and likes and all that are nice to have in
the short term because it tells you whom to pay attention to if you
are new. It’s unfortunate that there is a network effect going on,
however, so it would be great if this reputation were ephemeral, or at
least backgrounded in the user interface so that it’s only there if
you look for it and if it is upheld by sustained contribution. It
would also be nice if such reputation were tied to topics such that
they didn’t easily transfer. Being good in one area should not give
you authority in another.</p>

## I may never see my wife climax again – and the thought makes me really sad

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<p>Four years ago she told me she would take responsibility for her own pleasure and bought a vibrator, which she uses alone. It makes me feel inadequate</p><p><strong>My wife and I are </strong><strong>in our mid-50s and have been married for nearly 30 years. Around </strong><strong>four years ago my wife stopped having orgasms when we had sex, and told me that she would now take responsibility for her own orgasms. This involved buying a vibrator and masturbating when I’m not around. She says this is the only way she can climax. I</strong><strong> have suggested that we try to do this together, but my wife won’t agree to this. </strong><strong>Even though we still have sex together, I</strong><strong> am left feeling inadequate and selfish afterwards. I suspect she would rather not bother with our lovemaking at all. The thought of never seeing her climax again is really sad, but am I overthinking it? Should I just enjoy what’s on offer and leave her to her private orgasms?</strong></p><p>I’m sorry that you are experiencing such a change in your erotic connection, and I can understand that it is a profound loss for you. It seems that this is a fairly new situation and given time you may be able to negotiate a little more access, but for now I suggest you leave her be. Taking responsibility for one’s own orgasm is something many women need to do – both during partner sex and when alone – and it does not necessarily reflect a partners’ technique or adequacy although that is often his fear. And there are many reasons why a woman might decide to withdraw as your wife has done, usually to allow herself to reach orgasm without distraction. Try not to take it personally, and instead of feeling selfish during intercourse, just enjoy it fully.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

```html
<p>I feel the same, about many things. I want to have ambulances, and hospitals, and dentistry, and warm water, drinking water from the tap… and I don’t care about roads, cars, chat bots, marketing campaigns and the other bullshit. The more energy and CO₂ something needs, the harder we must press the question: is this something that we need while the world is burning?</p>
```

```html
<p>Don’t add fuel to the fire. Don’t waste electricity even if it’s cheap, now. It’s cheap because the market is broken. The market is broken because we’re not factoring in externalities. Externalities aren’t factored in because some people benefit and nobody seems to suffer at first. Whales, all our wildlife, trees, clean air, clean water – all these things have been treated as zero value, their loss has not been accounted for, and that’s why things that destroy them are often cheaper than the things that care about the environment.</p>
```

```html
<p>A system that doesn’t measure value with empathy – a system built and maintained by sociopaths! – is encouraging all the economic actors to find loopholes where externalities can bear the brunt of the cost because the resulting product will be so much cheaper. Nobody has to pay for the dead whales! How convenient for those who have no heart but only greed.</p>
```

```html
<p>The more I think about it, the more I think that the root cause of all the things that go wrong is that psychopaths are in charge, designed systems of incentives and punishments that reward the exploitation of others. It’s only when the many who actually have a heart that bleeds get together and change the system that we see improvements. Reduced working hours had to be fought for. The end of slavery had to be fought for. The end of child labour had to be fought for. And we will have to fight for the end of cars. We will have to fight for the end of parking lots. We will have to fight for the end of huge concrete buildings. We will have to fight for higher taxes of the rich.</p>
```

```html
<p>If we don’t, then the entire system will not degrow in good order. We will lose ambulances together with all the cars. We will lose drinking water and bridges and other critical infrastructure with all the roads.</p>

<p>We need to set our priorities for the time we have left.</p>

The reason I say this is that I see how things are going at the workplace. I’ve been in projects where every merge request triggers a rebuild and a run of the entire test suite. This was for Java projects with over a million lines of code. The tests ran for many minutes. All this CO₂ spent boggles the mind.</p>
```

```html
<p>Now, people doing this always have good arguments. Quality, cutting cost, and so on. Sometimes the problem is that externalities are not priced in. What they say is true because the end of the world coming closer is free. So the company is not going to change. The customer isn’t going to change, either. They want software to support their business, they are prepared to pay a certain amount and to them it doesn’t matter how the software is made. If we could write quality software without bugs that didn’t require automated testing for the same price, they’d buy it. But as it is, nobody feels like they have any choice except to give up the system and that’s not going to happen until the system breaks down or is dismantled.</p>

## Oddmuse lessons learned for Oddµ

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<h1>Oddmuse lessons learned for Oddµ</h1>
```

```html
<p>As I was working on Oddmu I often considered the things I wanted to do different from how I had done things for Oddmuse.</p>
```

```html
<p>Oddmuse is a first and foremost a CGI script written in Perl. Over the years, I have written a few web applications using the Mojolicious framework. These are all independent web servers. Apache, the actual web server, ends up being the reverse proxy for all of them.</p>
```

```html
<p>I don’t really like this setup. Using CGI scripts optimizes a site for few requests. When nobody is requesting the site, no resources are being used, no memory is taken up, no files are open. The drawback is that every request requires a new process, and in the case of Perl, recompilation of the code. As bots rule the web and crawl sites in the name of backlink detection, marketing and search, it is increasingly difficult to optimize a site for few requests. There are always a lot of requests and when I complain about it, inevitably somebody shows up to tell me that actually that isn’t a lot of requests and did I consider caching and static files and on and on. We should all be concerned with using resources parsimoniously.</p>
```

```html
<p>This is why Oddmu is a web server and not a CGI script. Using Go made it possible to write a web server that is fast, doesn’t use too much memory and that was still reasonably easy for me to do.</p>
```

```html
<p>Using a statically compiled language made it impossible for me to include “plugins” that change the code at run-time. Oddmuse loads more files from a subdirectory, allowing users to override all aspects of it. I often moved code that I wanted to override for my own projects into separate functions. Configurability and rewriting the application was a goal right from the start. I was heavily influenced by Emacs where most of its code can be rewritten by users.</p>
```

```html
<p>The drawback is that this affords a lot of trivial hacks, extensions to the markup rules, and so on. And once I started thinking about the move <em>away</em> from Oddmuse, I realised that I had achieved my own vendor lock-in. Worse, since Oddmuse has been in use over 20 years for this site, some very old pages hadn’t seen any change in many years. Perhaps the markup rules had changed and it was only the cached HTML that was still being served correctly. Any change to an existing page would regenerate the HTML cache using the new rules, possibly resulting in a page that looked broken.</p>
```

```html
<p>So this was something to avoid. What is the solution? Either write HTML directly – or limit markup to something that allows me to simplify the easy stuff and add HTML for the rest. That solution is Markdown with as little extra rules as possible.</p>
```

```html
<p>In fact, I’ve managed to add just three special rules:</p>
```

```html
<ul>
<li>Hashtags that link to searches</li>
<li>Fedi account links</li>
<li>Wiki links with double square brackets</li>
</ul>
```

```html
<p>Wiki links with double square brackets are only useful for single-word links such as <code>[[RPG]]</code>, at least on this wiki. That’s because Oddmuse follows the UseMod convention (which is also the Wikipedia convention since at the very beginning Wikipedia used UseMod) of using the underscore for spaces in page names. Almost all the previous pages therefore use an underscore in page names to represent a space. So I was faced with these options:</p>
```

```html
<ul>
<li>implement the full functionality with link text override (<code>[[PageName|link text]]</code>) and underscore-space-equivalence (<code>[[Page Name]]</code> links to <code>Page_Name</code>)</li>
<li>use double square brackets for a few simple single word page names</li>
<li>not implement double square bracket links at all</li>
</ul>
```

```html
<p>I decided to use a very simple implementation only: no link text override (use standard Markdown links for that) and no spaces-to-underscore magic.</p>
```

```html
<p>Let’s see how far I can take Oddmu without adding markup rules.</p>
```

```html
<p>Another lesson I took from Oddmuse being a CGI script with a hackable markup was that it would be tricky to generate static pages for it. I was caching some of the generated HTML, which was clever and sped things up, but I also had some parts of a page that depended on other pages: searches, transclusion, and “red links” – links to missing pages showing up in a different colour or with the more traditional question-mark link. This made it hard to write static pages since every time you created or edited a page you needed to know: is this page transcluded anywhere? Every time you created a new page you needed to know: do other wiki pages link to this formerly missing page? These pages needed to be updated. This would require a link database, or a search that was aware of all the possibly dynamic linking markup, and if changes to other pages were to result, these would invalidate existing HTML caches and render these page that the user hadn’t seen anew, possibly corrupting them.</p>
```

```html
<p>In short, it was a big headache.</p>
```

```html
<p>This is why Oddmu doesn’t implement markup features that depend on the existence of other pages, nor on the content of other pages. No red links, no journal pages, no inlined search results.</p>
```

```html
<p>And finally, I decided that I’d write the tools that I needed, that I really needed for my own maintenance into Oddmuse as subcommands for the administrator – the person with shell access, or with some sort of option to sync the files.</p>
```

```html
<p>I didn’t need to replicate grep, but when search and replace with dry runs (previews) started to get difficult, I wrote the “replace” subcommand. When I started caring about missing pages, I wrote the “missing” subcommand. When I wondered about generating page HTML and using it in other programs, I wrote the “html” subcommand. When I wondered about archiving, I wrote the “static” subcommand.</p>
```

```html
<p>And with that it seems I have both a wiki server <em>and</em> a static site generator. I think I like it. Currently, I’m using Oddmu as a wiki server.</p>

```

```html
<p>Another benefit of staying as close to Markdown + HTML as possible is that “export is everything” (<a href="http://thoughtstorms.info/view/ExportIsEverything" rel="nofollow">Phil Jones on ThroughtStorms</a>, on a Tweet by Chris Albon). For the export of text to be useful, however, the markup has to be widely understood. This is why there is a benefit in using Markdown + HTML rather than an eclectic mix of hacked together markup.</p>

## Phoebe lessons learned for Oddmu

<h1>Phoebe lessons learned for Oddmu</h1>
```

```html
<p>In 2020, I was very interested in <a href="Gemini" rel="nofollow">Gemini</a>. I felt that the web was
failing me and that swiching back to <a href="Gopher" rel="nofollow">Gopher</a> might be an answer. I
wanted to go back to document oriented hypertext and not use a modern
browser that is basically a separate operating system in a box to
power applications to incidentally also browse the old web. No, this
is backwards, I felt. Browsers were beasts. I was not alone.</p>
```

```html
<p>This is what Drew DeVault had to say in <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html" rel="nofollow">The reckless, infinite scope of web browsers</a>:</p>
```

```html
<blockquote>
<p>I used wget to download all 1,217 of the W3C specifications which
have been published at the time of writing, of which web browsers
need to implement a substantial subset in order to provide a modern
web experience. I ran a word count on all of these specifications.
How complex would you guess the web is?</p>
```

```html
<p>The total word count of the W3C specification catalogue is 114
million words at the time of writing. If you added the combined word
counts of the C11, C++17, UEFI, USB 3.2, and POSIX specifications,
all 8,754 published RFCs, and the combined word counts of everything
on Wikipedia’s list of longest novels, you would be 12 million words
short of the W3C specifications.2</p>
```

```html
<p>I conclude that <strong>it is impossible to build a new web browser</strong>. The
complexity of the web is <em>obscene</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
```

```html
<p>People rediscovered Gopher and began writing new “Gopher holes”. People
started thinking about making changes, adding transport layer security
(TLS) and MIME types, and more. Gemini was born. It was possible for a
single person to write Gemini servers. It was possible for a single
person to write Gemini clients. I was all in. I had written an Oddmuse
extension that served my pages via Gopher. I wrote another Oddmuse
extension that served my pages via Gemini. I developed a Gemini
sister-protocol called Titan which allowed me to post pages, too. I
wrote a wiki that used Gemini and Titan, called Phoebe. I added
virtual hosts. I added a web user interface. I started up <a href="https://transjovian.org/" rel="nofollow">The
Transjovian Council</a> which was served by
Phoebe using Gemini and the web. I added an implementation of the
<a href="https://internetoracle.org/" rel="nofollow">Internet Oracle</a>. I added a MUSH. I
added a journaling game. I added an interesting network blocker. I
added “Gemini capsule” hosting.</p>
```

```html
<p>It didn’t catch on. What did seem to catch on, however, was people
editing their own sites, hosting them with software that served static
files and nothing more. I think the problem was that I wanted to use
protocols that were simpler than the web so that I could build
interesting applications. But nobody else wanted to build interesting
applications because if you wanted that, why look to Gopher and Gemini
in the first place.</p>
```

```html
<p>When Phoebe started running into out-of-memory errors and I was unable
to figure out what caused it, I dediced to end it. Three years later,
I was no longer interested. I can still read what other people are
writing using Gemini because
<a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/" rel="nofollow">Lagrange</a> is a beautiful client.
But it’s also a complex client and I’m never going to write an
equivalent client. Perhaps this puts me in the shoes of people that
looked at my Perl code. It’s weird.</p>
```

```html
<p>So this is what I learned for Oddµ: The wiki is for single authors
first and foremost. All the wiki features like revisions, diffs,
histories, recent changes – they only matter if you have enthusiastic
collaborators that you don’t know and I haven’t seen that in a very
long time. So that’s why Oddµ lacks all those features. Most people
aren’t going to need them. If you do, you can check the files into
git, and people can make their changes there. Have a commit hook trigger a redeployment and the site updates. You can get revisions, diffs,
histories and recent changes from git.</p>

<p>The idea of small groups of people collaborating, a handful of
friends, is still a powerful one. For these cases I was prepared to
make a single allowance: The URL paths are structured in such a way
that you can use a web server acting as reverse proxy to setup
authentication an authorization. The web server gets to know the
usernames and passwords, and who gets to view and edit and search
which subdirectories. None of that is built into Oddmu. All Oddmu does
is use directories consistently such that it is possible to set this
up.</p>

```html
<p>You need to protect your site on the Internet from vandals and spammers.
But if your site is private, if it runs only for your team or your
friends or your family or your tilde, then it’s optional. Authentication,
authorization, usernames and passwords, Apache as the front-end, its all
optional.</p>

<p>I feel like my opinions evolved alongside yours.</p>
```

```html
<p>You remember Epoch2020. I revitalized
<a href="https://communitywiki.org/" rel="nofollow">CommunityWiki</a>, or so I like to say! Then
I moved on to revitalizing the TourBus. Where are they now? Both
silent. I now focused on <em>my</em> sites. I am known for
<a href="https://mycorrhiza.wiki/" rel="nofollow">Mycorrhiza</a>, a wiki engine for many users.
But many of the wikis end up having no more than one… My next
project, <a href="https://betula.mycorrhiza.wiki/" rel="nofollow">Betula</a>, ended up being
single-user, but federated. Seems like this is <em>the</em> next model. One
could suspect that federation is not needed for bookmarking, but I do
end up reposting others’ bookmarks, and one other person does so, so
maybe it’s a good idea after all!</p>
```

```html
<p>So, being single-user is the trend now.</p>
```

```html
<p>Gemini. We became enthusiastic about it at around the same time, which
is Gemini creation time, and slowly lost interest. It is read-only for
me now. Sure, Betula supports saving Gemini links, there is unique
content there, no doubt. But WWW is not so bad after all! It’s
actually pretty good. Much better than Gemini.</p>
```

```html
<p>Oddµ brought me mixed feelings.</p>
```

```html
<p>On one hand, it’s the end of <a href="https://oddmuse.org/" rel="nofollow">OddMuse</a>. One of
the few pulses of the old Wiki Web. One of the few what I call
‘classic’ wiki engines left. The other being
<a href="https://moinmo.in/" rel="nofollow">MoinMoin</a> (ver 2 abandoned, ver 3 developed for
12 years) and <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/" rel="nofollow">MediaWiki</a> (too big for
me).</p>
```

```html
<p>On the other hand, it’s a new project of yours! I always welcome them.
And this one is in Go! I use Go too. A fellow Gopher!</p>
```

```html
<p>On the third hand, calling it a wiki engine is kind far-reaching. Or
not? Nobody really knows what a wiki is nowadays. I’m still on my
quest to find a definition that would please me. But I’m certain Oddµ
is not a classic wiki engine. Markdown!? The whole page naming
approach. No recent changes!? Recent changes are so fundamental, how
can you be without them!?</p>

<p>Thank you for sending that email and allowing me to publish it here.
I added some links for context so people can find the things mentioned.</p>
```

```html
<p>You are definitely right with respect to Community Wiki. I guess Emacs
Wiki is still alive and it uses Oddmuse so I don’t plan on “sun-setting”
Oddmuse. I haven’t been developing any big new features in a long time
and now I just know that for my own projects, I have an alternative.</p>
```

```html
<p>As for calling Oddmu a wiki: It works like a wiki if you hand out
accounts. One could work on automating this, having people register and
all that, but then you need to think about all the things that I’ve been
able to avoid: revisions, diffs. Who knows, perhaps there’s a solution
to be found somewhere. Numbered backup files that expire after 30 days,
perhaps? Right now you can look at the source files and the last backup
file: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2023-10-08-phoebe-lessons.md" rel="nofollow">A</a>
and <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2023-10-08-phoebe-lessons.md~" rel="nofollow">A~</a>.
Currently, there is no diff.</p>
```

```html
<p>Perhaps one could do something like the following: if the code wants to
write a backup file, make sure that it doesn’t overwrite backup files
less than 60 min old. Then add a diff functionality which effectively
groups all the edits of an hour. Perhaps that would be enough.</p>
```

```html
<p>As for changes, a similar solution might be a checkbox for the edit form
which is set by default. If set, a new link is added to the “changes.md”
file (like the links on <a href="index.md" rel="nofollow">index.md</a>) if doesn’t already exist. If it
already exists, just move it to the top.</p>
```

```html
<p>I think I want to go back to such “crude” implementations of features
because of something I recently read on Ward Cunnigham’s page about</p>
```

```html
<blockquote>
<p>Workflows describe productive activities that are well supported but
not enforced by wiki.</p>
```

```html
<p>We rely on discovered sequences of primitive actions to complete
tasks that might be directly supported by designed features in a
monolithic system. Primitives, cautiously created when needs arise,
are closely aligned with the necessary software operations.</p>
```

```html
<p>Workflows might start life as a workaround for a missing feature
only to be recognized later to be a versatile solution that does not
require additional user affordance.</p>
</blockquote>
```

```html
<p>I think this is similar to my attempt at sticking with Markdown and HTML
for Markup.</p>
```

```html
<p>Oh, and by the way:
As I was looking for the Smallest Federated Wiki link, I stumbled upon
<a class="account" href="https://artoot.xyz/@interstar" title="@interstar@artoot.xyz" rel="nofollow">@interstar</a>’s page on <a href="http://thoughtstorms.info/view/SmallestFederatedWiki" rel="nofollow">SmallestFederatedWiki</a>
page which led me to <a href="http://thoughtstorms.info/view/LeavingTheSFW" rel="nofollow">LeavingTheSFW</a>.
It has some interested drawbacks of a fancy UI, fancy file format, and so on.
The <a href="http://thoughtstorms.info/view/HelloWorld" rel="nofollow">HelloWorld</a> page makes me think that
Phil Jones has been thinking about similar things.</p>
```

```html
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thoughtstorms.info/view/CardiganBay" rel="nofollow">CardiganBay</a>
is being written partly as a new wiki-engine; one which combines
classic wiki ideas and values with new technologies and internet standards.</p>
```

```html
<p>Partly as a personal note-taking / PersonalKnowledgeManagement / DigitalGardening
engine which can help capture and organize my ideas. And even help turn them into
actions, or more coherent “products” (such as essays or longer-form pieces of writing).</p>
</blockquote>
```

```html
<p>Lots of good stuff.</p>
```

```html
<p>All of this to loop back to features and Recent Changes. I suspect that I hesitated
about automatically having Recent Changes is that it immediately adds the need for
minor and major changes because small typos and mass changes (global search and
replace operations, of which there have been thousands on this wiki in recent days
and weeks) shouldn’t show up there. That’s also why the directory listing is not
enough. But if we had a flag that is implicitly off for changes happening from the
command line, then that might work.</p>
```

```html
<p>And this entire idea only works because I decided to create feeds based on lists of
links of files. It also reminds me of the very first Recent Changes where the wiki
added links to a page but it was up to people to expire old links, or reorder the list.
So that’s where I’m headed, if anywhere at all.</p>

## Recent Changes is back

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<h1>Recent Changes is back</h1>
```

```html
<p>Björn wrote me an email saying he missed Recent Changes. <a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org" rel="nofollow">@Sandra</a> wrote me an email saying she used Recent Changes a lot. <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town" rel="nofollow">@bouncepaw</a> wrote me an email saying he used Recent Changes a lot. Clearly, I needed to take another look.</p>
```

```html
<p>The first question to consider is why I didn’t appreciate Recent Changes. I think I checked Recent Changes obsessively because I was afraid of vandalism and spam. I was also somewhat anxious about comments. I like agreement but I’m quite conflict averse. So with the possibility of strangers making edits gone, there seemed to be no point to Recent Changes.</p>
```

```html
<p>The way Bouncepaw put it in an email was that he used it when “continuing where they left off”.
Sandra had been involved in a site years back and said “the place was deadsville until we figured out a way to put recent changes on the front page and then it came alive”. Björn said he knew I was often adding comments to old pages and he enjoyed following along. With Recent Changes gone, the <a href="index" rel="nofollow">front page</a> just listed <em>new</em> pages and he’d lose access to those updates.</p>
```

```html
<p>All of these are valid points.</p>
```

```html
<p>I needed something like the font page, a page with links. Oddmu already knows how to turn these into a feed. I didn’t want to keep a log like I had done for Oddmuse, where every change was logged as either “minor” or “major”. People didn’t quite understand what this was for. I also couldn’t do without a distinction because in the last few days and weeks I have made thousands of small changes from the command line, trying to fix broken links and the like. Those changes should definitely not show up on Recent Changes.</p>
```

```html
<p>I finally remembered how Recent Changes had worked on Ward’s Wiki, also know as the Portland Pattern Repository, the first wiki.</p>
```

```html
<blockquote>
<p>Note that RecentChanges is not a database query of some sort: it is just like any other WikiPage, editable and textual. It’s just that the server takes an interest in adding to the end of it (and in deleting redundant lines). – <a href="https://kidneybone.com/c2/wiki/WhatIsRecentChanges" rel="nofollow">What is Recent Changes?</a></p>
</blockquote>
```

```html
<p>(Note that the link above points to a mirror that strips the Javascript redesign from the original wiki, <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?WhatIsRecentChanges" rel="nofollow">WhatIsRecentChanges</a>.)</p>
```

```html
<p>And so I went back to that idea. The server adds links to <a href="changes" rel="nofollow">changes</a> whenever I edit or add to a page and don’t remove the checkbox that says “add link to the list of changes”.</p>
```

```html
<p>Oh, and diffs are also back. I don’t keep a version history, but I do have backup files for an emergency. One step of undo is better than no undo, surely.</p>

## Eve by Cat Bohannon review – long overdue evolutionary account of women and their bodies

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<p>The American writer traces the female form back to our ‘true ancestors’ in an epic combination of science and speculation that places women at the centre of history</p><p>Consider the aorta: our body’s largest artery stiffens and slackens with age, like overstretched elastic, and can bulge out forming an aneurysm that’s prone to rupture. Aortic aneurysms occur six times more often in men than women. But if a woman does have one, it’s more likely to burst, she’s less likely to get effective treatment and more likely to die. These outcomes are a tangle of sex (influenced by chromosomes, physiology and hormones) and gender (how we identify, behave in our environment and interact with one another). Why is our society calibrated for men so that women receive substandard medical care? And why are researchers not studying half the world’s population who are excellent at not getting aneurysms?</p><p><em>Eve</em> is interested in the origins of such questions, plumbing the depths of what’s different – for better and for worse – about the female body. This long overdue evolutionary account is the pre-history to Caroline Criado Perez’s <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/invisible-women-9781784706289">Invisible Women</a> </em>(2019), showing how wrong it is to think of women as just men with breasts and wombs bolted on. Over hundreds of thousands of years, women have developed more sensitive noses (particularly around ovulation and pregnancy), finer hearing at high frequencies, extended colour vision, and longer life expectancy than men by an impressive half decade. Forget plasma exchange and supplementation – entrepreneurs trying to extend human life should be studying women, who comprise around 80% of today’s centenarians.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/10/eve-how-female-body-drove-200-million-years-of-human-evolution-by-cat-bohannon-review">Continue reading...</a>

## Ethiopian drought and child marriage – in portraits

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<p>A series of double exposure portraits by Maheder Haileselassie Tadese, winner of the 2023 Contemporary African Photography prize, represents the impact of severe drought on the lives of girls in Ethiopia</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Maheder Haileselassie spent time with girls in the Somali region in eastern Ethiopia, capturing their experiences on the frontline of climate change. Girls in parts of the country hit by drought and food shortages are increasingly being forced into child marriage, with rates rising by 119% in 2022. Bone-dry water sources, decimated crops and dying livestock have combined with vicious conflict to make early marriage a threat to them. Mahader said: “Listening to the girls’ experiences of child marriage it struck me that each story was linked to the changing climate. Recurrent drought in the Somali region means that the earth no longer provides families with the water and nutritious food that they need. This is why I made the drought-affected landscape and dried river an integral part of each portrait, to represent how child marriage and climate change intertwine.”</p><p>A new report by Save the Children – Girls at the centre of the storm: Her planet, her future, her solutions – reveals that the number of girls living in high-risk “hotspots” for child marriage and climate change is set to increase by a third, to nearly 40 million by 2050.</p><p><em>Since being displaced, life has been difficult. We used to live a beautiful life. We lived comfortably. We used to plough in our fields. We used to have everything we needed. We made a good living. We didn’t struggle. We grew and ate whatever we wanted from our garden. Now we have nothing to eat, we are suffering a lot, we live in a shack house and the heat is terrible. We don’t have electricity like we used to. We are just living here in the hope that it will pass.</em></p><p><em>I was married at the age of 15. My parents married me off thinking our problems would become easier.

@"~Jessica Smith's blog" (date: 2023-10-10)

```html
<p>So, Viv and I have now cast early votes in the Voice to Parliament referendum. We voted “yes”, of course, even though we both feel like the proposal is pretty weak. It’s basically to create a body which would be purely advisory, and it’d have to be pretty toothless to be something large sections of the political and capitalist class can get behind. I’m reminded of that anarchist quote, “If voting changed anything, they’d make it illegal”… if the Voice would give Indigenous people meaningful influence over the settler-colonial Australian state, the state would never allow it.</p>
<p>That said, it was never clear to me how the “progressive no” campaign imagined that the failure of this referendum would become a springboard for more radical changes. I think if the referendum fails (and unfortunately that looks likely), that’s going to embolden the forces of racist reaction, not radicals. Furthermore over 80% of Indigenous people support the Voice proposal, and really it should be up to them. Even an advisory body might have some influence with some governments, on some issues, after all.</p>

## Flatpacks and floorfillers: how an Ikea became one of the world’s biggest nightclubs

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<p>The furniture giant’s ex-London flagship is now a giant venue – boasting a Batman movie set and not a Billy bookcase in sight. Our writer hits the dancefloor on opening night to ‘chuck out his chintz’</p><p>When Ikea opened its gigantic flagship store in Tottenham in 2005, at one minute past midnight on a February Thursday, six people ended up in hospital. Thousands of bargain-hunters had flocked to the London outpost, lured by the promise of leather sofas for just £45, resulting in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/feb/10/money.uknews">a frenzied stampede</a>, and the store having to close its doors after only 40 minutes. As one shopper put it: “Madness descended.”<br><br>Eighteen years later the vast furniture warehouse has been reborn as <a href="https://drumshedslondon.com/">Drumsheds</a>, one of the world’s largest nightclubs: a 15,000-capacity venue set to host the biggest names in dance music. And judging by its opening on Saturday, the clubbers are a decidedly less rowdy bunch than the frantic sofa-seekers.<br><br>“We’re about safety, safety, safety,” says Simeon Aldred, co-founder of venue operator Broadwick Live. He is standing in what was once Ikea’s undercroft car park, now the space where punters are channelled through serried ranks of bag checks, sniffer dogs and body search lanes, like herds of (sparkly) cattle. “Yes, it might take 40 minutes to get through the search, but once you’re in you feel safer.”</p><p>Over the last few years, Aldred and his team have professionalised the warehouse rave experience, taking over mighty post-industrial venues and filling them with top-notch sound systems, cutting edge digital screens and dynamic lighting rigs that rise and plunge above throbbing crowds. Their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/02/save-the-last-dance-london-superclub-printworks-aims-to-reopen-in-2026">Printworks</a> venue turned a hulking former newspaper press in Rotherhithe into a cathedral of electronic music, while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/09/tottenham-gas-works-to-transform-into-drumsheds-mega-venue">their original Drumsheds</a> took over a majestic gasworks near the Ikea site in 2019 – before it was swiftly shuttered by Covid. But can a big-box retail store conjure the same gritty magic as those cavernous industrial halls? Or will the ghosts of Billy bookcases and their missing screws forever haunt the dancefloor?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/oct/10/flatpacks-floorfillers-ikea-worlds-biggest-nightclubs-chintz">Continue reading...</a>

## Barentsburg: the Norwegian town feeling the chill of the Ukraine war

<p>Relations sour between Svalbard town’s Russian and Ukrainian communities while local tourism company is accused of being ‘arm of the Russian state’</p><p>“Barentsburg welcomes you” read the white letters in Russian above the dock. From the moment visitors step off the boat, there is little doubt who is at least symbolically in charge of this small town of a few hundred in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. Russian flags fly from buildings. The local pub, the Red Bear, charges punters in roubles. A bust of Lenin looks out across the fjord, behind it a monument declaring: “Our goal is communism!”</p><p>Yet this is not Russia, but Norway. The mining town may have been owned by the Soviet Union (and subsequently, Russia) since 1932, but it is located on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is resolutely Norwegian. Under a treaty drawn up in 1920, the Norwegian government has “full and absolute sovereignty” of Svalbard in return for equal rights of abode to citizens of signatory countries, including Russia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/barentsburg-the-norwegian-town-feeling-the-chill-of-the-ukraine-war">Continue reading...</a>

## Embrace the climb! How stairs can super-charge your fitness in seconds

date: 2023-10-10

```html
<p>They’re everywhere, they’re free and low-impact. No wonder more and more people are ditching long runs – and taking the stairs instead</p><p>You might not have noticed, but most modern hotels hide their stairways. Depending on who you ask, this is either for safety, security or aesthetics (stairwells are ugly, unless you design them to match the other decor) – but it means that people tend to be surprised when they see you running up them. I find a huffed-out “Morning!” is one of the best ways to break the tension. A lot of those you meet walking downstairs in hotels at 7am are probably quite hungover, or at least groggy. Still, they’re usually very polite.</p><p>I know this because – and this feels like a slightly embarrassing admission – I’m a Stairs Guy now. It’s always been a lurking part of my psyche, in one way or another: I’ve never been able to stand on the right on the underground, or wait for a lift if it’s only going a couple of floors. Still, I’m not alone. Stair-running is a pastime on the rise, at least if you look at the amount of events catering to it. The first ever full-scale tower race, reportedly, <a href="https://www.toureiffel.paris/en/news/events/5th-annual-eiffel-tower-vertical-race">took place at the Eiffel Tower in 1905</a>, with about 300 runners climbing a mere two levels (729 steps) of the monument. More events followed, but it took a while before the sport spread to the UK (via an inter-university race <a href="https://www.london-athletics.com/news_posts/marking-50-years-since-the-gpo-tower-race/">up the BT tower in 1968</a>), and the US (the <a href="https://www.esbnyc.com/empire-state-building-run">Empire State Building Run-Up</a> debuted in 1978). Today, hundreds of events across dozens of countries allow the light-limbed and large-lunged to race each other up some of the world’s most recognisable skyscrapers, while everyone else is gently encouraged to pace themselves to the top.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/10/embrace-the-climb-how-stairs-can-super-charge-your-fitness-in-seconds">Continue reading...</a>

## Will Hurd Suspends Presidential Bid, Endorses Nikki Haley

date: 2023-10-10

Former Republican Texas congressman Will Hurd suspended his presidential bid on Monday and endorsed fellow GOP primary candidate Nikki Haley, officially abandoning a brief campaign built on criticizing Donald Trump at a time when his party seems even more determined to embrace the former president.

“While I appreciate all the time and energy our supporters have given, it is important to recognize the realities of the political landscape and the need to consolidate our party around one person to defeat both Donald Trump and President Biden,” Hurd wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

He added that Haley, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump and governor of South Carolina, "has shown a willingness to articulate a different vision for the country than Donald Trump and has an unmatched grasp on the complexities of our foreign policy.”

Hurd was the last major candidate to join the already crowded Republican primary field when he announced his run in late June. He leaves the race barely three months later, after failing to gain traction as pragmatic moderate who pledged to lead the party away from Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement. Hurd failed to qualify for both the first GOP debate in Milwaukee in August and the second debate the following month in Simi Valley, California.

“America is at a crossroads and it’s time to come together and make Joe Biden a one-term president,” Haley wrote on X in response to Hurd's endorsement. "Thank you @WillHurd for your support and confidence. We have a country to save!"

Hurd ending his campaign follows another Republican candidate, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who became the first presidential hopeful to suspend his campaign shortly after failing to make the first debate stage.

Hurd wasn’t invited to the Milwaukee event after falling short of Republican National Committee minimums on support in the polls and sufficient numbers of donors to his campaign.

Hurd was initially defiant about missing the first debate, arguing that the Republican Party blocked him for refusing to sign a pledge for its presidential candidates to support the eventual primary winner, even if it was Trump. The RNC standards are “arbitrary, unclear, and lack consistency. This is an unacceptable process for a presidential election,” he said in a statement.

When he didn’t make the second debate, Hurd stuck a different tone, writing on X that “we narrowly missed the cut for the second debate and our campaign is at an inflection point.”

A clandestine CIA officer who worked in Pakistan, Hurd served three terms in the House through January 2021 and was the chamber’s only Black Republican during his final two years in office. He represented Texas’ then-most competitive district, which was heavily Hispanic and stretched from the outskirts of San Antonio to El Paso, encompassing more than 800 miles of Texas-Mexico border.

Hurd opted not to seek reelection in 2020, saying he was pursuing opportunities outside Congress “to solve problems at the nexus between technology and national security.” Last year, he traveled the country promoting his book “American Reboot: An Idealist’s Guide to Getting Big Things Done.”

The 46-year-old has long been a fierce Trump antagonist, even encouraging the then-Republican presidential nominee to leave the 2016 race when the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump brags about sexually assaulting women was made public in the final weeks before Election Day.

Hurd was hoping to resonate with voters seeking a pro-business Republican with a strong national security background who was also unafraid to seek bipartisan consensus. He announced his candidacy criticizing both Biden and Trump, saying the president wasn’t up to securing the U.S.-Mexico border, combating fentanyl smuggling that has led to epidemic of American overdoses and violent crime and homelessness in the country’s cities.

“President Biden can’t solve these problems — or won’t,” Hurd said in his announcement video. “And, if we nominate a lawless, selfish, failed politician like Donald Trump — who lost the House, the Senate, and the White House — we all know Joe Biden will win again.”

Hurd stepped up his public criticism of Trump as the former president was repeatedly indicted and now faces four separate criminal cases and 91 total charges. Trump still holds a fundraising advantage and commanding lead in early primary polls.

As a result, Hurd’s few memorable moments as a White House candidate came when he was heckled by Republican crowds after repeating assertions that Trump, should he clinch the GOP nomination, would lose the general election to Biden.

“Donald Trump is running to stay out of prison,” Hurd declared at a July GOP dinner in Iowa. When sustained booing followed, he responded, “Listen, I know the truth is hard.”

## Three New California Climate Programs to Watch

date: 2023-10-09

California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed more than a dozen climate and clean energy-related bills into law on Saturday. As the Golden State is one of the nation’s most important labs for climate policy, there were three developments in particular that I think will be interesting to keep an eye on as they progress over the next few years.First, and probably most relevant on a national level, Newsom put his signature on two bills that will require large businesses to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions as well as any risks to their business due to climate change. I wrote about these bills a month ago when they were up for a vote in the state Assembly. They mirror similar policies under consideration by the Securities and Exchange Commission that could soon be adopted at the federal level, but go further because they apply to private companies in addition to publicly-traded firms.The new laws were sold as a measure to help investors understand how exposed different companies are to future carbon regulations or climate change risks, but they could also go a long way to standardize the reporting of corporate emissions data. That data could help activist groups hold companies accountable for their climate promises and help consumers compare the sustainability efforts of different brands. The next step will be for the California Air Resources Board to develop rules for the new disclosure system by 2025, with reporting to begin in 2026. I’ll be following that rulemaking process closely, as it’s likely to bring up ongoing debates about how companies should account for emissions from indirect sources, like their purchased electricity and supply chains, as well as how to account for carbon offsets.The second development is a set of laws that are designed to help California overcome major obstacles for its inchoate offshore wind industry. Almost a year ago, the federal government auctioned off the first-ever leases to develop offshore wind in the Pacific, selling five parcels in total. California sees offshore wind as an essential component of its climate goals, as it has the potential to generate power at night when the state’s abundant solar resources disappear. But because the continental shelf drops off abruptly just a few miles from the California shore, plunging thousands of feet, the turbines will have to be built on floating platforms — a much more expensive proposition than the wind projects under development on the East Coast, which are already threatened by cost overruns. These will be big, risky, projects, and developers need certainty that there will be a buyer for the energy at the end of the road. But it would be hard for a traditional utility to make that kind of commitment at this point, Molly Croll, the director of Pacific offshore wind at the trade group American Clean Power, told Canary Media last month. “It’s new technology,” she said. “It requires some new infrastructure; it requires a contract signed much longer in advance of commercial operation than typical renewable projects require.”Under the new legislation, California will set up a central procurement program, tasking the Department of Water Resources, which owns and operates hydroelectric power plants in the state, to enter into long-term energy purchase agreements with wind developers. This is similar to programs in place in the northeast, like the New York State Energy and Research Development Agency’s offshore wind solicitation program. Notably, the department will also have the authority to enter into similar contracts with other expensive, risky, but potentially game-changing clean electricity projects like geothermal power plants and energy storage facilities. Meanwhile, a second bill that Newsom signed will get the ball rolling for the state to develop strategies to upgrade its port infrastructure to support the new industry.The third development is interesting mainly because it’s one of those ideas that sounds so obvious that after you hear it, you can’t believe it’s not already a thing. The new law will enable the state to make use of the tens of thousands of miles of land it owns alongside highways for clean energy development. It instructs the California Department of Transportation to develop a plan to lease the land to utilities or other entities to build solar, storage, and transmission projects. A recent analysis commissioned by the nonprofit advocacy group Environment California found that just three counties in southern California — Los Angeles, Ventura, and San Diego — together have 4,800 acres of suitable space for roadside solar development, which, if filled with panels, could power more than 270,000 homes. The group Environment California also points out that this could be a way to generate revenue for the state through lease fees and energy sales. Land use for solar is contentious, especially in California, and putting as much as possible in the rights-of-way alongside highways could avoid battles over the use of undeveloped or agricultural land.

## What Polls Can Miss About Americans’ Love of Wind and Solar Power

date: 2023-10-09

Renewables are popular, and most Americans don’t mind living near them. That’s the message of an      interesting new poll from The Washington Post and the University of Maryland, which found that about 70% of Americans would be comfortable living near a wind or solar farm “in their community.” Now, Americans slightly prefer solar over wind, and there’s a partisan gap among the respondents — 79% of Democrats are comfortable living near a wind farm, while only 59% of Republicans are — but overall the message is clear: Americans as a whole don’t mind living near a new renewables project.

```html
</p><p style="">
    It’s great to see this poll, and it adds to a growing and now, I think, unimpeachable body of research that shows renewables remain broadly popular in the United States. In March, <a href="https://heatmap.news/americans-love-solar-and-want-it-on-their-roofs" target="_blank">a Heatmap poll</a> found that 72% and 76% of Americans, respectively, would welcome utility-scale wind and solar in their communities. We found that the only more popular form of electricity generation was rooftop solar (which 
    <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2023-06-29/can-rooftop-solar-alone-solve-climate-change-heres-the-answer-boiling-point" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>can’t solve climate change</u></a> by itself), backed by nearly 9 in 10 Americans:
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media" style="text-align: center;"><iframe aria-label="Column Chart" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="500" id="datawrapper-chart-PoDmf" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PoDmf/2/" style="border: none;" title="I would welcome into my community ..." width="680">
</iframe></div><div style="">
<p>
    In June, the Pew Research Center found 
    <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/06/28/majorities-of-americans-prioritize-renewable-energy-back-steps-to-address-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>similar majorities</u></a> in its polling, although it also noted that the partisan gap over renewables <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/06/28/what-americans-think-about-an-energy-transition-from-fossil-fuels-to-renewables/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>was continuing to widen</u></a>. Only 60% of Republicans favor building more wind power today, according to Pew, as compared to 80% in 2016. (Over the same period, Democrats have become modestly <em>more</em> supportive of expanding wind.)
</p>
<p>
    These polls are important. They demonstrate that renewable advocates can draw on a broad base of public support — or, at least, indifference — when fighting for policy. But I worry that they send the wrong message to environmentalists who are wondering about how best to move forward in the fight against climate change. Both the 
    <em>Post </em>and Heatmap polls ask almost identical questions: Would you welcome a wind or solar farm <em>in your community</em>? But neither poll clarifies exactly what “your community” means.
</p>
<p>
    Luckily, a recent study examines the question more deeply. In 2021, a team of researchers 
    <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/193920/1/WP583.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asked 4,500 people in America, Germany, and Ireland</u></a> whether they would accept a new solar, wind, or fossil-fuel plant near them. Unlike other studies, it got specific: Would you accept a solar farm less than a mile from where you live? How about one to five miles away? How about more than five miles?
</p>
<p>
    The study found very big majorities in support of wind and solar: 89% and 92% of Americans would welcome a new wind or solar facility near them 
    <em>at all. </em>But the closer that the project got to their house, the less they favored it. Only 17% of Americans would welcome wind turbines within a mile of their home. About half would approve of wind turbines within five miles. By comparison, about a third of Germans would welcome wind turbines within 0.6 miles of their home (that is, a kilometer), and two-thirds of Germans would within three miles.
</p>
<p>
    In the study, solar was more popular than wind — 57% of Americans would welcome solar panels within five miles of their home — but, still, it didn’t see the kind of commanding majorities you’d expect from Heatmap and the 
    <em>Post</em>’s polling. In fact, I think this study tells an entirely different story from those polls: that Americans are pretty skeptical of new renewable projects in their backyards. (The bright spot for climate advocates is that a much smaller ratio of Americans support the construction of a new natural gas plant within five miles of their homes.)
</p>
<p style="">
    That 2021 study suggests that a small minority — and in some cases, an outright majority — might oppose a given renewable project depending on how close it is to a residential area. 
    <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/wind-farm-protests-leah-stokes-pnas" target="_self"><u>And as I’ve previously written</u></a>, American laws today give even a small, well-resourced minority plenty of tools to block a project. They can hold up a project in lawsuits or bog it down in paperwork. And what’s more, once that small group starts campaigning against a project, the public’s broad but shallow support for, say, a general technology can crater. That’s what happened recently in New Jersey, where a once broadly pro-wind public <a href="https://stockton.edu/news/2023/windmill-support-drops-hughes-poll.html#:~:text=In%202019%2C%2080%25%20of%20adult,today%20by%20the%20William%20J." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has turned against</u></a> four proposed offshore wind farms.
</p>
<p style="">
    Is this the 
    <em>biggest</em> problem for renewable advocates? I’m not sure: America will <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/09/06/us-solar-installations-expected-to-be-a-record-32-gw-in-2023/#:~:text=The%20US%20solar%20industry%20is,(SEIA)%20and%20Wood%20Mackenzie." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>build plenty of new solar projects</u></a> this year anyway. But it is <em>a </em>problem. And it should be clear by now that broad public opinion does not mean much for our land-use politics. The problem is <em>not</em> that the public opposes wind and solar; the problem is that a few dozen people <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/wind-farm-protests-leah-stokes-pnas" target="_self"><u>can block or waylay a project</u></a> no matter how the broader public feels. If that feels anti-democratic, then climate advocates need to do something about it.

## We deserve better from Apple: why I can no longer recommend a Mac to fellow blind computer users

date: 2023-10-09

As many of you will know from personal experience, there is a longstanding issue with VoiceOver on Mac where Safari will frequently become unresponsive with VoiceOver repeatedly announcing the message “Safari not responding.” When this issue occurs, the user&#8217;s Mac may become unusable for up to several minutes at a time. Sometimes it can be resolved by switching away from Safari. Sometimes restarting VoiceOver can resolve the issue. However, far too often, the user is unable to switch away from Safari or turn VoiceOver off, instead having to simply wait for their Mac to become responsive again. This “Safari not responding” behaviour when using VoiceOver dramatically impacts productivity and overall usability of Macs for blind and low vision users. Furthermore, it appears that the issue extends beyond just Safari &#8211; many other common applications that utilise Apple&#8217;s WebKit browser engine can also be affected by the “not responding” problem. I&#8217;m not highlighting this to make Apple look bad &#8211; for once &#8211; or to fill some quota. The fact of the matter is that in the blind and vision-impaired community, the Mac and iPhone are immensely popular for their accessibility features other platforms just cannot match. If you&#8217;ve ever seen a blind person use an iPhone, you know just how different their way of using it is from sighted people. As such, having a major bug like this is a huge deal. It impacts people who really have nowhere else to go, technology-wise, since switching to other platforms really isn&#8217;t a viable option in most cases. This issue must be fixed, and can&#8217;t be left by the wayside because it only impacts a relatively small number of people. Blind and vision-impaired folks have placed their trust in Apple because they&#8217;ve got nowhere else to go, and Apple needs to step up and take this seriously. Now.

## When ZFS was young

date: 2023-10-09

ZFS was promised, and didn&#8217;t arrive. In fact, there were about 4 of us on the beta program who saw the original zfs implementation, and it was quite different from what we have now. What eventually landed as zfs in Solaris was a complete rewrite. The beta itself was interesting &#8211; we were sent the driver, 3 binaries, and a 3-line cheatsheet, and that was it. There was a fundamental philosophy here that the whole thing was supposed to be so easy to use and sufficiently obvious that it didn&#8217;t need a manual, and that was actually true. (It&#8217;s gotten rather more complex since, to be fair.) Peter Tribble &#8211; long-time Solaris expert and creator of Tribblix &#8211; gives a gimpse into the earliest versions of ZFS, and just how different it was from the shipped release.

## Using microVMs for gaming on Fedora Asahi

date: 2023-10-09

Running a 16K page size kernel implies some userspace applications that assume that the page size is 4K will break. While the Asahi Team did an amazing work fixing many of them, there’s little anyone can do (at least, at a scale) to fix applications that ship in binary form. And the prime example of this are x86_64 (a 4K page size platform) games. While it’s technically possible to run Apple Silicon devices with a 4K page size kernel, that would require a number of (potentially controversial upstream) changes in the kernel and will probably have a significant impact on the performance. A better approach would be running the host with a 16K kernel, and use a 4K kernel in a VM for those problematic workloads, as long the performance of the VM was good enough for the use case. When Eric first asked me about this, my first reaction was “well, we would need to import virtio-gpu, but even then the performance wouldn’t be good enough for gaming”. But, what if we could bring Rob Clark’s DRM native context to Asahi? While I&#8217;m not a fan of buying locked-down, proprietary hardware that can change its capabilities to run non-approved operating systems at a moment&#8217;s notice, there&#8217;s absolutely no denying there&#8217;s a lot of cool stuff going in the Asahi Linux world, and this is just one of many. Now, can we please &#8211; please! &#8211; get capable ARM machines from someone other than Apple?

## MiniDisc hacking

date: 2023-10-09

Most MiniDisc aficionados are aware of unit hacking to gain access to new features. The unit that perhaps benefits the most from this is the Sony MZ-N510, which also comes in the N520 and NF610 variants. The 2001 model R700 can be hacked to add many features of its upscale brother, the R900, as well as the Type-R codec, which renders the R700 capable of performing real-time SP recordings with Sony&#8217;s last evolution of ATRAC1. I bet the market for hacking the best music format of all time is small these days, but this is still incredibly cool.

## 789 KB Linux without MMU on RISC-V

date: 2023-10-09

In this guide, we’ll build a very tiny Linux kernel, weighing in at 789 K, and requiring no MMU support. We’ll write some userspace code and this will be deployed on a virtual RISC-V 64-bit machine, without MMU, and we’ll run some tiny programs of our own. As a reminder, please go through the guide for a micro Linux distro to understand the concepts behind what we’re doing today: building the kernel, initramfs, etc. This guide is basically a continuation of that one and an exercise in making an absolutely minimal Linux deployment for (in theory) extremely cheap hardware. This follows up on the mentioned earlier article.

## ‘Calves are the biceps of the legs!’: Arnold Schwarzenegger’s seven big life lessons

<p>Find opportunity in failure – and don’t let your legs get in the way of world domination. Here is the distilled wisdom of Arnie’s first foray into self-help</p><p>He told us that he’d be back – but, after nearly 60 years in the public eye, Arnold Schwarzenegger has never gone away. Ever since his first trip to the US from Graz, Austria, in 1966, the Terminator has taken on a remarkable number of guises: bodybuilder, action hero, villain and even – in a move that seemed ludicrous in 2003, but in fact foretold decades of politics to come – the elected governor of California.</p><p>Arnie’s latest step-change is something more predictable: a “self-help guy”, as he puts it. Twelve years since leaving office, Schwarzenegger has just published his seventh book, Be Useful, sharing his “seven tools for life” and lessons learned in each of his various incarnations. What it does not include, beyond a passing reference to “rock bottom” and an allusion to hurting his family, is his 1996 infidelity when married to Maria Shriver; fathering a love child with his housekeeper; and the more recent allegations of his groping several women, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/06/arnold-schwarzenegger-expresses-regret-over-groping-claims">that he apologised for earlier this year.</a> Still, there is plenty in it for anyone keen to match his $450m estimated net worth or <a href="https://generationiron.com/best-biceps-bodybuilding/">enormous biceps</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/09/calves-are-the-biceps-of-the-legs-arnold-schwarzeneggers-seven-big-life-lessons">Continue reading...</a>

## How Much Can Heat Vary Within a City? These Kids Strapped on Sensors to Find Out.

date: 2023-10-09

According to legend, the ghost of Lucy Addison still roams the halls of her namesake middle school in Roanoke, Virginia. She’s particularly fond of the basement, where the art and technology rooms are. So when Brian Kreppeneck got a few thermal cameras for a summer program he was running this year, he knew exactly how he was going to teach his students how to use them: with a ghost hunt. He took them downstairs to the auditorium, shut off the lights, and had them train the cameras on things like the air-conditioning vents, a digital clock blinking in one corner, and the empty auditorium stage. “And wouldn't you know it, as we're looking at the auditorium stage, a little mouse ran across the auditorium,” Kreppeneck, a science teacher at the school, told me. “They screamed and ran out, and that’s how they learned to use the thermal cameras.” The cameras had a use beyond ghost-hunting and scaring schoolchildren (and mice): The students were going to use them to measure temperatures in and around their school. Over the course of a week, they pointed the cameras at all kinds of things in the world around them, from basketball courts baking in the sun to the shady ground underneath trees. They also clipped sensors to their shoes, which measured ambient temperatures as the kids went about their days. But that was just the beginning.Get one great climate story in your inbox every day: indicates requiredEmail Address  Our Privacy Policy & Terms Apply.

Study after study has shown that cities are noticeably hotter than surrounding rural areas; this is called the Urban Heat Island effect. Many studies have also shown that the hottest parts of most cities tend to be the areas that house lower-income communities and communities of color, thanks to a dearth of vegetation, tightly packed buildings, and an overabundance of construction materials that radiate heat like concrete. Richer neighborhoods, meanwhile, tend to be lusher, with more space between buildings and, often, building materials like wood or brick that do a better job of dissipating heat. </p><p>But understanding just how the built environment affects heat is pretty hard. Meteorologists and weather apps tend to draw data from sensors at airports, which can’t give us any insight into the contours of heat within specific neighborhoods. The numbers we see on our phones often don’t reflect the temperatures we feel; a neighborhood by a river or a park, for example, would be much cooler than a neighborhood with high concentrations of concrete and asphalt, yet residents in both places would see the same temperature in their apps or on TV. </p><p style="">After a week of collecting data with another teacher, the middle-schoolers came back to Kreppeneck’s classroom to figure out what all the numbers had to say. Put together, the data from the thermal cameras and the shoe sensors created something few of us get to see: a personalized look at how the built world around them shaped the way heat worked in their lives. As Lim and Kreppeneck expected, the temperatures the kids experienced were often higher than the temperatures measured by the sensors at a nearby airport, sometimes by as much as 30 degrees Fahrenheit:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

If we follow a few of the blue lines, which represent students from Addison middle school — the one with the ghost — we see some of their personal temperatures spiking high above the black line. This could be for a few reasons: maybe they’re playing basketball on a concrete court, or eating lunch outside, or walking around a neighborhood with few trees.<br/></p><p style="">But on each day, when the black line is at its peak, we see almost all of the students’ temperatures dip far below it. That was when the kids were cooling off indoors, often in air-conditioned buildings. As day turns to night, we see temperatures at the weather station dip below what some of the kids experienced indoors. By the next morning, as the kids start going about their days, their lines spike above the weather station again. </p><p>“Before they did this activity, if you asked one of these middle school kids if humans can control the temperature outside, they’d say no way,” Lim said. “But then they start to make these correlations: Humans make decisions about where to plant trees, or where to build parking lots, or what color different surfaces should be. And so we kind of <em>do</em> control the outdoor temperature.” </p><p>This kind of realization also shifts heat away from being a personal issue that can be solved by, say, drinking water or cranking the air conditioner, to a systemic one. There’s something kind of freeing about this: Lim said that instead of being ashamed that their families might not be able to afford air conditioning, the students came to recognize that their neighborhoods were historically hotter because of decisions made by other people. Northeast and Southeast Roanoke, for example, both saw higher temperatures than the Northwest and Southwest quadrants, and the entire city was significantly hotter than the rest of Roanoke County:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

The bars show the range, while the boxes are the average. </small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy Theodore Lim.</small></p><p style="">Armed with their temperature data, the students spent the second week of their summer program in Kreppeneck’s class learning about urban planning and mapping out ways their own neighborhoods could be redesigned to mitigate heat.</p><p>“As science teachers, we’ve always struggled to make the connection between science in the classroom and home,” Kreppeneck told me. “There’s always been some sort of a wall there, where the kids just think science takes place in the classroom. But giving them a real-world project made these concepts transcend the classroom.” </p><p style="">Kreppeneck also talked to his students about activism and advocating for change. This was the idea of Virginia Tech’s Lim; activism gives the kids a sense of agency over their built environment, and it also encourages them to start conversations with the adults in their lives who previously might not have paid much attention to climate change, whether due to a lack of information or the impression that it didn’t impact them. But climate change continues to push global temperatures higher — this September was the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/september-2023-hottest-heat-zeke-hauffather" target="_self">hottest on record</a> — and the effect of climate change on heat is becoming increasingly harder to ignore. Creating policy to deal with those changes, however, is a difficult task. </p><p>“In Roanoke, as is probably the case in many cities, there's kind of a lot of contention between the government and some of these more vulnerable communities because of the history of urban renewal,” Lim said. </p><p>As Martha Park writes in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-19/an-illustrated-history-of-urban-renewal-in-roanoke" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beautiful illustrated history</a> for <em>Bloomberg</em>, northeast Roanoke was a thriving home for black and immigrant residents prior to urban renewal, a policy James Baldwin once called “negro removal.” Then, in 1955, the city declared the area “blighted,” seized the entire neighborhood through eminent domain, burned the buildings to the ground, and even exhumed nearly a thousand bodies from the local cemetery, dumping them in a mass grave outside town. Today, the area is mostly pavement and industrial parks.</p><p style="">“There’s a lot of mistrust on both sides,” Lim told me. “I’ve found that using youth-based community science is a relatively uncontroversial way of getting at some issues that actually do have very deep systemic causes.”</p><p>This was the third year Lim ran his program in Roanoke. In earlier years, Lim ran the program by himself at just one of the schools; this summer’s group, consisting of 130 students from all five Roanoke middle schools over the course of six weeks, was by far the largest, and Kreppeneck and another teacher took over most of the day-to-day. Going forward, Lim hopes it’ll turn into something more than a middle-school summer program; community leaders are talking about putting together a climate action plan for the city, and he’s exploring the possibility of creating programs at local high schools and churches that build on the middle school curriculum. The idea is to get the message about heat, and the solutions for it, out into the community in as many ways as possible. </p><p>Kreppeneck’s already planning on incorporating urban heat into his syllabus for the spring semester, expanding the two-week summer program into something that the students can engage with on a deeper level. </p><p style="">“My hope is that the kids will start talking about it, and start taking ownership,” Kreppeneck said. “Watching the looks on their faces, watching how the wheels started turning as to how they would change their neighborhood, it was very rewarding. If they believe in something, they can make change. It starts with them.”</p><p><em>Read more about heat:</em></p><p><a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/what-is-the-heat-index" target="_blank">A Guide to the Hottest Measurements in Temperature</a></p>

## Native American Languages Fight for Survival

date: 2023-10-09

Monday in the United States is celebrated as both Columbus Day and as Indigenous Peoples' Day.

When the Spanish-financed Italian explorer Christopher Columbus made contact with native inhabitants of the Caribbean in 1492, there were more than 500 languages spoken across the Americas. In the land that became the United States, the remaining number of such languages has dwindled to about 100. Most now have only a handful of speakers.

Alex Fire Thunder’s two young boys are a thriving exception as their ethnic Lakota language again has thousands of aspiring speakers.

“I want them to have a strong sense of their Lakota identity. Language is everything. It’s something that nobody can take away from them,” says Fire Thunder, Oglala Lakota from the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and deputy director of the Lakȟól'iyapi kiŋ nawéčižiŋ (Lakota Language Consortium).

Fire Thunder is optimistic his sons, Odowan, 3, and Iyoyanpa, 2, will have others besides themselves to converse in Lakota when they grow up.

“There are immersion schools. There are other second-language learners learning the language and teaching their children,” Fire Thunder, who has been among those formally teaching Lakota in schools, tells VOA.

That was not the case for decades.

“My mom is a speaker, but she did not transmit the language to my siblings and I,” he says.

For generations, Native American children in North America were sent to boarding schools where they were immersed in American culture and punished for speaking their own languages.

Teaching and learning these Indigenous languages in the 21st century are a challenge because there are scant resources and opportunities remaining.

“If you want to learn Spanish, there are a number of countries you can go to where all you’re going to hear is Spanish and you’re going to be expected to speak Spanish, as well,” Fire Thunder says.

For Lakota learners there are limited options. Some elders converse in Lakota at the post office or senior centers.

“The elders that do speak are, at this point and time, all bilingual so there is no situation where you absolutely have to use Lakota,” Fire Thunder explains. “That’s something you’re not going to find if you go to Spain or Mexico.”

Lakota is part of the Sioux language group and primarily heard in the Dakotas. A unique aspect of the language is the use of kinship terms, considered an essential to Lakota cultural expression, and many of the terms do not have precise English equivalents.

“There are only about 10 to 15 languages left in the U.S. that have any viable chances in terms of moving forward beyond the next 50 years,” according to Wilhelm Meya, chairman of The Language Conservancy.

When languages lose their last fluent speakers, it can also mean the demise of their Indigenous songs and prayers.

“The average speaker is about 75. Children for the most part are not learning the language,” Meya tells VOA. “So, there’s a lot to do in order to try to get these languages back on their feet.”

Meya’s organization is a nonprofit dedicated to preserving, protecting and promoting endangered languages. It currently partners with 52 Indigenous communities. One successful project has been the creation of the New Lakota Dictionary, considered the most expansive Native American dictionary.

Hundreds of Indigenous linguists, educators and scholars are to gather this week in Bloomington, Indiana, to share knowledge and inspire language revitalization efforts.

“For the elders and the speakers, they want to pass on the language, and they want to do so with hope they’re going to leave a legacy for generations going forward,” Meya says.

## One reason I miss Frontier

date: 2023-10-09

```html
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/12/26/frontier.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Quick note -- I'm working on a deep database feature in <a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a>, adding support for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22reading+lists%22">reading lists</a>. Deep in the sense that it's under several layers of user interface. It's like digging up the foundation of a house and figuring out how to add a new room on the third floor. It's something of a high wire act, but I honestly think I figured it out. </p>
<p>It's far from the first time I've implemented reading lists, I've done it before with simpler apps in JavaScript, and richer apps many years ago, in <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>.</p>
<p>This time it's in JavaScript and MySQL, and thus is, in one way, fairly compariable to UserTalk and Frontier's object database. But we didn't have the SQL querying capability in Frontier, so it's not comparable in that way. What we're doing now in FeedLand would not have been possible in Frontier.</p>
<p>To implement this feature in MySQL I needed two tables to the database, one for reading lists, and the other for reading list subscriptions. This part is very easy. Not necessary in Frontier's object database because the structure is ad hoc, like JavaScript objects are ad hoc. You could store relational database tables in a JS object, but there would be nothing to prevent you from breaking the rules in some or all of the "records."</p>
<p>Where it gets complicated is the code to access the database, and use the reading lists while everything is running. The Frontier code to implement the structures would also be simple, and easy to debug. It's just straight line code, with if's and else's. The runtime takes care of suspending your thread when you need to wait for a result, it does not show up in the syntax of the language. The Frontier programming language also has an intimate relationship with its database, whereas in JavaScript and MySQL there are layers of levels between the JS stack and the database. There really don't need to be any layers at all, that's what Frontier proves. </p>
<p>It took me years to dig out from under all the layers and gruntwork that's here that wasn't in Frontier to figure out what exactly the difference was.</p>
<p>And since I designed Frontier, this is self-praise, for which I apologize, but let me share with you the secret that makes Frontier so much better. For years in development I factored and refactored every time I came up with a simpler way to do something. I had been programming for a decade when I started Frontier, and had used some great highly factored tools before -- specifically Unix and THINK C, and I understood the process, having done it with commercial Mac, IBM and Apple II end-user products. I treated every aspect of development as you would treat the user experience of end-user software. And since you are an intimately involved user, there's a huge advantage here. I just had the time, and took the time to do the factoring that so far no one else has taken. At least to my knowledge and that's a big caveat because we don't generally use each others' platforms in tech, unlike other arts and sciences, we tend to live in and create our own caves. But Frontier was a product at one point, with several thousand people working in it, and most of them understand what I'm talking about here .</p>
<p>PS: I asked ChatGPT for <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/105ed538-237d-4e52-862e-a876ffb2575e">five distinguishing features</a> of Frontier.</p>

## Nobel Economics Prize Goes to Professor for Advancing Understanding of Workplace Gender Gap

date: 2023-10-09

The Nobel economics prize was awarded Monday to Claudia Goldin, a professor at Harvard University, for research that has advanced the understanding of the gender gap in the labor market.

The announcement went a tiny step to closing the Nobel committee’s own gender gap: Goldin is just the third woman to win the prize out of 93 economics laureates.

She has studied 200 years of women's participation in the workplace, showing that despite continued economic growth, women's pay did not continuously catch up to men's and a divide still exists despite women gaining higher levels of education than men.

“Understanding women’s role in the labor market is important for society. Thanks to Claudia Goldin’s groundbreaking research, we now know much more about the underlying factors and which barriers may need to be addressed in the future,” said Jakob Svensson, chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences.

Goldin does not offer solutions, but her research allows policymakers to tackle the entrenched problem, said Randi Hjalmarsson, a member of the prize committee.

“She explains the source of the gap, and how it’s changed over time and how it varies with the stage of development. And therefore, there is no single policy," Hjalmarsson said. "So it’s a complicated policy question because if you don’t know the underlying reason, a certain policy won’t work.”

However, “by finally understanding the problem and calling it by the right name, we will be able to pave a better route forward,” Hjalmarsson said.

Goldin had to become a data sleuth as she sought to fill in missing data for her research, Hjalmarsson said. For parts of history, systematic labor market records did not exist, and, if they did, information about women was missing.

“So how did Claudia Goldin overcome this missing data challenge? She had to be a detective to dig through the archives to find novel data sources and creative ways to use them to measure these unknowns,” Hjalmarsson said.

Of receiving the award, Goldin, 77, “was surprised and very, very glad,” Ellegren said.

It follows the awards in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace that were announced last week.

The economics award was created in 1968 by Sweden's central bank and is formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.

Last year's winners were former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, Douglas W. Diamond and Philip Dybvig for their research into bank failures that helped shape America’s aggressive response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

Only two of the 92 economics laureates honored have been women.

A week ago, Hungarian-American Katalin Karikó and American Drew Weissman won the Nobel Prize in medicine. The physics prize went Tuesday to French-Swedish physicist Anne L’Huillier, French scientist Pierre Agostini and Hungarian-born Ferenc Krausz.

U.S. scientists Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov won the chemistry prize on Wednesday. They were followed by Norwegian writer Jon Fosse, who was awarded the prize for literature. And on Friday, jailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi won the peace prize.

The prizes are handed out at awards ceremonies in December in Oslo and Stockholm. They carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1 million). Winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma.

## ‘Upending the genre’: the children’s author rewriting the rules of sex ed

date: 2023-10-09

```html
<p>A new trio of books for kids focuses on consent, kindness and curiosity. Author Cory Silverberg explains why we need to rethink talking with young people about sex</p><p>“I see my role as a trusted adult,” says Canadian sex educator <a href="https://www.corysilverberg.com/" title="">Cory Silverberg</a>. “A lot of advice for parents skims over the fact that they are not good at stuff. We’re bad at friendships. We are bad with money: we do an online shop at 1am, but we also know we need to make our kids financially literate. At the end of a long day, if my kid asks a question, I’ll give them a short answer. That is why we need trusted adults.”</p><p>It’s hard to think of an area that needs a trusted adult to update and rejig it more than sex education. And with a trio of books – <em>What Makes A Baby</em>,<em> Sex is a Funny Word </em>and<em> <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/you-know-sex-9781644210802" title="">You Know, Sex</a></em> – illustrated with friendly faces and unintimidating bodies by artist Fiona Smyth, Silverberg may have done just that. The trilogy, according to the <em>New York Times</em>, has “quietly upended the genre”. The books are aimed at audiences from young children up to teens and educate children in calm, neutral terms, making room for diverse experiences – and for doubt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/09/upending-the-genre-the-childrens-author-rewriting-the-rules-of-sex-ed">Continue reading...</a>

## Pluralistic: How Google's trial secrecy lets it control the coverage; The Lost Cause prologue, part III (09 Oct 2023)

date: 2023-10-09

Today's links How Google's trial secrecy lets it control the coverage: You got it wrong, but we won't tell you how. The Lost Cause prologue, part III: Going viral in the free world. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading How Google's trial secrecy lets it control the coverage (permalink) "Corporate crime" is practically an oxymoron in America. While it's true that the single most consequential and profligate theft in America is wage theft, its mechanisms are so obscure and, well, dull that it's easy to sell us on the false impression that the real problem is shoplifting: https://newrepublic.com/post/175343/wage-theft-versus-shoplifting-crime[51] Corporate crime is often hidden behind Dana Clare's Shield Of Boringness, cloaked in euphemisms like "risk and compliance" or that old favorite, "white collar crime": https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/07/solar-panel-for-a-sex-machine/#a-single-proposition[52] And corporate crime has a kind of performative complexity. The crimes come to us wreathed in specialized jargon and technical terminology that make them hard to discern. Which is wild, because corporate crimes occur on a scale that other crimes &#8211; even those committed by organized crime &#8211; can't hope to match: https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/12/no-criminals-no-crimes/#get-out-of-jail-free-card[53] But anything that can't go on forever eventually stops. After decades of official tolerance (and even encouragement), corporate criminals are finally in the crosshairs of federal enforcers. Take National Labor Relations Board general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo's ruling in Cemex: when a company takes an illegal action to affect the outcome of a union election, the consequence is now automatic recognition of the union: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/06/goons-ginks-and-company-finks/#if-blood-be-the-price-of-your-cursed-wealth[54] That's a huge deal. Before, a boss could fire union organizers and intimidate workers, scuttle the union election, and then, months or years later, pay a fine and some back-wages&#8230;and the union would be smashed. The scale of corporate crime is directly proportional to the scale of corporations themselves. Big companies aren't (necessarily) led by worse people, but even small sins committed by the very largest companies can affect millions of lives. That's why antitrust is so key to fighting corporate crime. To make corporate crimes less harmful, we must keep companies from attaining harmful scale. Big companies aren't just too big to fail and too big to jail &#8211; they're also too big for peaceful coexistence with a society of laws. The revival of antitrust enforcement is such a breath of fresh air, but it's also fighting headwinds. For one thing, there's 40 years of bad precedent from the nightmare years of pro-monopoly Reaganomics to overturn: https://pluralistic.net/ApexPredator[55] It's not just precedents in the outcomes of trials, either. Trial procedure has also been remade to favor corporations, with judges helping companies stack the deck in their own favor. The biggest factor here is secrecy: blocking recording devices from courts, refusing to livestream the proceedings, allowing accused corporate criminals to clear the courtroom when their executives take the stand, and redacting or suppressing the exhibits: https://prospect.org/power/2023-09-27-redacted-case-against-amazon/[56] When a corporation can hide evidence and testimony from the public and the press, it gains broad latitude to dispute critics, including government enforcers, based on evidence that no one is allowed to see, or, in many cases, even describe. Take Project Nessie, the program that the FTC claims Amazon used to compel third-party sellers to hike prices across many categories of goods: https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/amazon-used-secret-project-nessie-algorithm-to-raise-prices-6c593706[57] Amazon told the press that the FTC has "grossly mischaracterize[d]" Project Nessie. The DoJ disagrees, but it can't say why, because the Project Nessie files it based its accusations on have been redacted, at Amazon's insistence. Rather than rebutting Amazon's claim, FTC spokesman Douglas Farrar could only say "We once again call on Amazon to move swiftly to remove the redactions and allow the American public to see the full scope of what we allege are their illegal monopolistic practices." It's quite a devastating gambit: when critics and prosecutors make specific allegations about corporate crimes, the corporation gets to tell journalists, "No, that's wrong, but you're not allowed to see the reason we say it's wrong." It's a way to work the refs, to get journalists &#8211; or their editors &#8211; to wreathe bold claims in endless hedging language, or to avoid reporting on the most shocking allegations altogether. This, in turn, keeps corporate trials out of the public eye, which reassures judges that they can defer to further corporate demands for opacity without facing an outcry. That's a tactic that serves Google well. When the company was dragged into court by the DoJ Antitrust Division, it demanded &#8211; and received &#8211; a veil of secrecy that is especially ironic given the company's promise "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful": https://usvgoogle.org/trial-update-9-22[58] While this veil has parted somewhat, it is still intact enough to allow the company to work the refs and kill disfavorable reporting from the trial. Last week, Megan Gray &#8211; ex-FTC, ex-DuckDuckGo &#8211; published an editorial in Wired reporting on her impression of an explosive moment in the Google trial: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/03/not-feeling-lucky/#fundamental-laws-of-economics[59] According to Gray, Google had run a program to mess with the "semantic matching" on queries, silently appending terms to users' searches that caused them to return more ads &#8211; and worse results. This generated more revenue for Google, at the expense of advertisers who got billed to serve ads that didn't even match user queries. Google forcefully disputed this claim: https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1709726778170786297[60] They contacted Gray's editors at Wired, but declined to release all the exhibits and testimony that Gray used to form her conclusions about Google's conduct; instead, they provided a subset of the relevant materials, which cast doubt on Gray's accusations. Wired removed Gray's piece, with an unsigned notice that "WIRED editorial leadership has determined that the story does not meet our editorial standards. It has been removed": https://www.wired.com/story/google-antitrust-lawsuit-search-results/[61] But Gray stands by her piece. She admits that she might have gotten some of the fine details wrong, but that these were not material to the overall point of her story, that Google manipulated search queries to serve more ads at the expense of the quality of the results: https://twitter.com/megangrA/status/1711035354134794529[62] She says that the piece could and should have been amended to reflect these fine-grained corrections, but that in the absence of a full record of the testimony and exhibits, it was impossible for her to prove to her editors that her piece was substantively correct. I reviewed the limited evidence that Google permitted to be released and I find her defense compelling. Perhaps you don't. But the only way we can factually resolve this dispute is for Google to release the materials that they claim will exonerate them. And they won't, though this is fully within their power. I've seen this playbook before. During the early months of the pandemic, a billionaire who owned a notorious cyberwarfare company used UK libel threats to erase this fact from the internet &#8211; including my own reporting &#8211; on the grounds that the underlying research made small, non-material errors in characterizing a hellishly complex financial Rube Goldberg machine that was, in my opinion, deliberately designed to confuse investigators. Like the corporate crimes revealed in the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers, the gambit is complicated, but it's not sophisticated: i. Make everything as complicated as possible; ii. Make everything as secret as possible; iii. Dismiss any accusations by claiming errors in the account of the deliberately complex arrangements, which can't be rectified because the relevant materials are a secret.

It comes out on Nov 14, and its early fans include Naomi Klein: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865939/the-lost-cause[63] Amazon won't sell my audiobooks, so I made my own, doing the narration this time around. I'm running a Kickstarter campaign to pre-sell the audiobook, ebook and hardcovers, including signed, personalized hardcovers &#8211; I hope you'll consider backing it: http://lost-cause.org/[64] This week, I'm serializing the prologue to the book. Here's part one: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/06/green-new-deal-fic/#the-first-generation-in-a-century-not-to-fear-the-future[65] And part two: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/07/met-cute-ugly/#part-ii[66] I woke at noon, the house hot because Gramps had left the blinds up in the front room, and ever since the big live oak had been cut up and taken away for blight, we’d lost its shade. I used the bathroom, pulled on shorts and a tee, and went looking for breakfast, or brunch, or whatever. “Gramps?” He didn’t answer. That was weird. Gramps was a late riser and he rarely got up before ten, and then he took a long time to get going, listening to his podcasts and drinking coffee and sending memes around to his buddies with his giant tablet, with the type zoomed way, way up. He didn’t like going out in the heat, either, so in the summer he rarely left the house before four or five, once the sun was low to the hills. He’d left his coffee cup in the sink and his tablet on the table, so I knew he’d gone in a hurry. He hated dirty dishes and hated dead batteries even more. I put his stuff away and thawed out some waffles and got a big iced coffee from the cold-­brew jug I kept in the fridge and started the process of becoming human. I gobbled my first waffle before the emotional weight of the previous night settled on me. Those emotions were way too big, so big that they all layered on top of each other, leaving me with nothing but numbness. I did the reflex thing and pulled out my screen, giving myself a brief sear of shame for my mindless screen-­handling, just as I’d been trained to do in mindfulness class. That was enough to prompt me to run through the checklist: Do I need to look at my screen? Do I need to look at it now? What do I hope to find? When will I be done? I answered the questions (Yes, yes, news about last night, when I’ve looked at two or three stories), and then unlocked it, but didn’t look at it until I’d poured myself another glass of coffee. Two hours later, there was no coffee left and my eyes hurt from screenburn. I dropped my screen, came out of my trance, and stood up. I’d gone viral. Or rather, Mike had. My post had been picked up, first in Burbank, then statewide, then nationally, then internationally. Amateur comedians had edited the footage into highlight reels, moments chosen to demonstrate just how idiotic and hateful he was. Someone made a White Nationalist Bingo Card whose every square had a quote from Mike Kennedy. There were lots of jokes about inbreeding, hillbillies, musket-­fuckers and ammosexuals, master race masturbation, senility, removable boomers—­all the age-­and class-­ based slurs that we weren’t allowed to say in school, but that everyone busted out as soon as we were off the property. It was pretty gross, but on the other hand, I couldn’t exactly argue with them. Bottom line was, Mike Kennedy had been up on that roof for no good reason, and he’d been ready to kill me to let him finish his stupid, senseless project. So yeah, fuck that guy. I guess. I was pleased to see that I came off as a hero, with strangers around the world praising me for my cool head, saying I’d saved his life. I put my plate in the dishwasher and wiped up my crumbs and checked the clock on the kitchen wall—­I’d always loved its plain analog face with its thick and thin lines, the yellowing AC cord that came off it. It had belonged to Gramps’s own parents, and it was the only thing in the house I considered anything like an heirloom. It was coming up on one and if I showered fast and ran, I could make my physics class. I decided to go for it, had the fastest shower in history, pulled on whatever was on the top of my dresser drawers, and sprinted for the street. I was just jogging up to the entrance to Burroughs when I got a screen chime, which stopped me because, like all the students, I’d installed the school app that turned off audible alarms while I was on property during school hours. It wasn’t mandatory, but the punishment for having an alarm in class was confiscation, so . . . I pulled out my screen as I panted by the doorway, mopping my face with my shirttail. It was a text from Burbank PD, informing me that Mike Kennedy was headed for a bail hearing in two hours, and I was entitled to present a victim impact statement, either recorded or in person. I’d known that the police could override the school app (there was a kid in my class whose parole office sometimes paged him, and the fact that he audibly dinged was just part of the package, I figured—­a way to remind us all that this kid had fucked up bad), but I hadn’t expected them to ping me, let alone on school property.

## Monday’s US Holiday Dilemma: Celebrate Columbus or Indigenous Peoples?

date: 2023-10-09

Monday is Columbus Day in the United States. It is also a day that many people now celebrate as Indigenous Peoples Day.

Columbus Day has been a federal holiday since 1937, in honor of Christopher Columbus’ so-called discovery of America.

Many people, especially Native Americans, have taken offense at the notion that Columbus discovered the Americas when there were already established and thriving peoples and civilizations on the North and South American continents.

Columbus Day is not just a holiday,” says Leo Killsback a professor of American Indian Studies at Arizona State University, “it represents the violent history of colonization in the Western Hemisphere” which includes slavery and the forced Christianity conversions of native peoples.

Indigenous Peoples Day is not yet a federal holiday, but President Joe Biden’s administration has officially recognized the day since 2021. Some U.S. states already recognize Indigenous Peoples Day instead of Columbus Day, while others continue to celebrate Columbus.

There is a push to have the second Monday in October renamed as the federal holiday Indigenous Peoples Day instead of Columbus Day. An act was reintroduced into Congress last week with that goal.

Some scholars believe that an Indigenous Peoples Day provides for a more realistic view of Native Americans and white settlers treatment of them.

## Why is Debian the way it is?

date: 2023-10-09

Debian is a large, complex operating system, and a huge open source project. It’s thirty years old now. To many people, some of its aspects are weird. Most such things have a good reason, but it can be hard to find out what it is. This is an attempt to answer some such questions, without being a detailed history of the project. The fact that Debian is a relatively slow-acting, complex democracy is probably why it has survived for so long, and why it&#8217;s become the bedrock for so many derivative distributions.

## Sonoma’s log gets briefer and more secretive

date: 2023-10-09

Little did we realise then that Sierra was going to change all that, and by Mojave we’d be enduring 4,000 and more log entries in a second, when our Macs were feeling loquacious. That was because Apple introduced the Unified log, with its entries written not in plain text but compressed binary format. This was the death-blow for the casual reader of logs: for a start, the replacement Console app was unable to access any log entries made in the past, and its tools were, and remain, woefully inadequate for tackling the increasing torrent of log entries. Despite its many great strengths, the Unified log has suffered two problems that are limiting its usefulness in Sonoma: its diminishing period of coverage, and censorship. This article highlights some real problems with the logs in macOS. Logs are so crucial in finding out why something is happening to a system so having them limited or restricted would drive me nuts.

@"~Dave Winer's Scripting News" (date: 2023-10-08)

We're in a long-term political depression. We don't study this like we do economic depression, but we should, because otherwise how will we get out of it? We have scholars tell us how to recognize fascism, authoritarianism, totalitarianism and all the other terrible human behavior that are on the rise. Let's also study how cultures emerged from these periods, if possible, without total destruction. Today total destruction might not be survivable on a species level. I just skipped over this the other day when I used the term for the first time. It just occurred to me that one way to emerge from it before it's too late is if a few Congressional Republicans took the Dems up on their offer to collaborate on choosing the next Speaker. Because enough come from majority Democratic districts, it might just get them re-elected next year. If they go the other way and support a Republican that's catering to the eight insane House members, the depression will continue unabated for more months or years. When you see an opening, first you have to actually see it.

## America's Nonreligious are a Growing, Diverse Phenomenon

date: 2023-10-08

Mike Dulak grew up Catholic in Southern California, but by his teen years, he began skipping Mass and driving straight to the shore to play guitar, watch the waves and enjoy "the beauty of the morning on the beach," he recalled. "And it felt more spiritual than any time I set foot in a church."

Nothing has changed that view in the ensuing decades.

"Most religions are there to control people and get money from them," said Dulak, now 76, of Rocheport, Missouri. He also cited sex abuse scandals, harming "innocent human beings," in Catholic and Southern Baptist churches. "I can't buy into that," he said.

As Dulak rejects being part of a religious flock, he has plenty of company. He is a "none" — no, not that kind of nun. The kind that checks "none" when pollsters ask "What's your religion?"

The decades-long rise of the nones — a diverse, hard-to-summarize group — is one of the most talked about phenomena in U.S. religion. The nones are reshaping America's religious landscape as we know it.

In U.S. religion today, "the most important story without a shadow of a doubt is the unbelievable rise in the share of Americans who are nonreligious," said Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University and author of "The Nones," a book on the phenomenon.

The nones account for a large portion of Americans, as shown by the 30% of U.S. adults who claim no religious affiliation in a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Other major surveys say the nones have been steadily increasing for as long as three decades.

So who are they?

They're the atheists, the agnostics, the "nothing in particular." Many are "spiritual but not religious," and some are neither or both. They span class, gender, age, race and ethnicity.

While the nones' diversity splinters them into myriad subgroups, most of them have this in common:

They. Really. Don't. Like. Organized. Religion.

Nor its leaders. Nor its politics and social stances. That's according to a large majority of nones in the AP-NORC survey.

But they're not just a statistic. They're real people with unique relationships to belief and nonbelief, and the meaning of life.

They're secular homeschoolers in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas, Pittsburghers working to overcome addiction. They're a mandolin maker in a small Missouri River town, a former evangelical disillusioned with that particular strain of American Christianity. They're college students who found their childhood churches unpersuasive or unwelcoming.

Church "was not very good for me," said Emma Komoroski, a University of Missouri freshman who left her childhood Catholic religion in her mid-teens. "I'm a lesbian. So that was kind of like, oh, I didn't really fit, and people don't like me."

The nones also are people like Alric Jones, who cite bad experiences with organized religion that ranged from the intolerant churches of his hometown to the ministry that kept soliciting money from his devout late wife — even after Jones lost his job and income after an injury.

"If it was such a Christian organization, and she was unable to send money, they should have come to us and said, 'Is there something we can do to help you?'" said Jones, 71, of central Michigan. "They kept sending us letters saying, 'Why aren't you sending us money?'"

Jones does believe in God and in treating others equally. "That's my spirituality if you want to call it that."

About 1 in 6 U.S. adults, including Jones and Dulak, is a "nothing in particular." There are as many of them as atheists and agnostics combined (7% each).

Many embrace a range of spiritual beliefs — from God, prayer and heaven to karma, reincarnation, astrology or energy in crystals.

"They are definitely not as turned off to religion as atheists and agnostics are," Burge said. "They practice their own type of spirituality, many of them."

Dulak still draws inspiration from nature, and from making mandolins in the workshop next to his home.

"It feels spiritually good," Dulak said. "It's not a religion."

Burge said the nones are rising as the Christian population declines, particularly the "mainline" or moderate to liberal Protestants.

The statistics show the nones are well-represented in every age group, but especially among young adults. About four in 10 of those under 30 are nones — nearly as many as say they're Christians.

The trend was evident in interviews on the University of Missouri campus. Several students said they didn't identify with a religion.

Mia Vogel said she likes "the foundations of a lot of religions — just love everybody, accept everybody." But she considers herself more spiritual.

"I'm pretty into astrology. I've got my crystals charging up in my window right now," she said. "Honestly, I'll bet half of it is a total placebo. But I just like the idea that things in life can be explained by greater forces."

One movement that exemplifies the "spiritual but not religious" ethos is the Twelve Step sobriety program, pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous and adopted by other recovery groups. Participants turn to a "power greater than ourselves" — the God of each person's own understanding — but they don't share any creed.

"If you look at the religions, they have been wracked by scandals, it doesn't matter the denomination," said the Rev. Jay Geisler, an Episcopal priest who is spiritual adviser at the Pittsburgh Recovery Center, an addiction treatment site.

In contrast, "there's actually a spiritual revival in the basement of many of the churches," where recovery groups often meet, he said.

"Nobody's fighting in those rooms, they're not saying, 'You're wrong about God,'" Geisler said. The focus is on "how your life is changed."

Scholars worry that, as people pull away from congregations and other social groups, they are losing sources of communal support.

But nones said in interviews they were happy to leave religion behind, particularly in toxic situations, and find community elsewhere.

Marjorie Logman, 75, of Aurora, Illinois, now finds community among other residents in her multigenerational apartment complex, and in her advocacy for nursing home residents. She doesn't miss the evangelical circles she was long active in.

"The farther away I get, the freer I feel," she said.

## US Sex Education Classes Often Don't Include LGBTQ+ Students

date: 2023-10-08

In fifth grade, Stella Gage's class watched a video about puberty. In ninth grade, a few sessions of her health class were dedicated to the risks of sexual behaviors.

That was the extent of her sex education in school. At no point was there any content that felt especially relevant to her identity as a queer teenager. To fill the gaps, she turned mostly to social media.

"My parents were mostly absent, my peers were not mature enough, and I didn't have anyone else to turn to," said Gage, who is now a sophomore at Wichita State University in Kansas.

Many LGBTQ+ students say they have not felt represented in sex education classes. To learn about their identities and how to build healthy, safe relationships, they often have had to look elsewhere.

As lawmakers in some states limit what can be taught about sex and gender, it will be that much more difficult for those students to come by inclusive material in classrooms.

New laws targeting LGBTQ+ people have been proliferating in GOP-led states. Some elected officials, including candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, have been pushing to remove LGBTQ+ content from classrooms.

Sex education curriculum varies widely. Some groups including Planned Parenthood have called for sex education to be inclusive of LGBTQ+ students, but some states outright forbid such an approach.

The penal code in Texas, for one, still says curriculum developed by the Department of State Health Services must say homosexuality is not acceptable and is a criminal offense, even though such language was deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003. Attempts in the Legislature to remove that line from state law have failed.

In practice, LGBTQ+ students say they have looked elsewhere for sex education. Some described watching their peers turn to pornography, and others said they watched videos on YouTube about how to tell if someone is gay and how to flirt with people of the same sex.

Gage grew up in Oklahoma before her military family relocated and she spent her eighth and ninth grade years in a U.S. Department of Defense school in the Netherlands. She then finished high school in Kansas, where she began to recognize she wasn't attracted only to men.

Not seeing a safe outlet at her high school to explore who she was, she went online to research for herself the history of the LGBTQ+ community in the U.S.

"I started to realize there is a huge portion of our history that is conveniently left out. But that history is important to queer youth," she said. She never really questioned gender or social norms, she said, until she started to learn about discrimination others have faced throughout history. "We have such rigid boxes that we expect people to fit into. If you didn't fit, you were called slurs. I wasn't really aware that if you strayed from those norms that people would feel you were attacking their way of life."

Still, the internet contains vast amounts of false information. Some advocates worry students turning to the internet to fill gaps in sex education will struggle to find their way through the morass.

"Any time you have a political controversy, there is a greater potential for a lot more disinformation to be generated," said Peter Adams, senior vice president of research and design at the News Literacy Project.

When schools address sexuality, it is often in the context of disease prevention or anti-bullying programs. School can be a difficult place if your identity is seen only in such negative ways, said Tim'm West, a former teacher and now executive director of the LGBTQ Institute at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta. West can relate: He grew up in Arkansas as a queer Black kid and preacher's son and was constantly made to feel ashamed.

"What if you are a boy in high school that knows you like boys, and you sit in a divided room and listen to a teacher explain how not to have sex with girls. You would be sitting there rolling your eyes, because that is not your issue. But you also haven't been given any instructions on how to protect yourself should you experiment with a person of the same gender," West said.

Students need more applicable sex education regardless of their gender identity or expression, said Gage, who volunteers with a youth justice advocacy group and is also president of the Planned Parenthood Generation Action Chapter at Wichita State.

"We all have to make large decisions for ourselves about our sexuality and reproductive health. Those decisions should be grounded in knowledge," she said.

Growing up in Washington, D.C., Ashton Gerber had more sex education classes than most. But Gerber, who is transgender, said the lessons weren't all that applicable to their experience.

"Even if you can have sex education every day of the year, there is always going to be something that gets left out," said Gerber, who is a student at Tufts University in Massachusetts. Gerber said educators should point students to trusted online resources so they can do their own research.

Not knowing who you are is a horrible feeling many LGBTQ+ students wrestle with, Gage said. But equally horrible is not feeling accepted once you do understand your sexual identity.

"Had I known then what I know now, I would have felt safe and confident coming out sooner," Gage said. "No one should feel like they don't understand themselves because we are forced to conformity in a world that doesn't care. We can all be inclusive."

## Zilog’s forgotten operating system: Z80-RIO

date: 2023-10-07

When it comes to famous operating systems for the Z80 and similar Zilog processors, the first and maybe only one to come to mind is CP/M, which was even made its presence known on the dual-CPU (8502 and Z80) Commodore 128. Yet Zilog also developed its own operating system, in the form of the comprehensively titled Z80 Operating System with Relocatable Modules and I/O Management (Z80-RIO for short). With limited documentation having survived, Ralf-Peter Nerlich has set out to retain and recover what information he can on RIO and the associated Programming Language Zilog (PLZ) after working with these systems himself when they were new. Catchy name, and awesome work to try and recover as much about it as possible.

## A quick look back at Microsoft’s Windows Home Server and its official children’s book

date: 2023-10-07

In just a few days, Microsoft will end support for Windows Server 2012 after over 11 years on the market. Ironically, the launch of the server OS in 2012 was also the official end for another server product from Microsoft that had first gone on sale on October 10, 2007, nearly 16 years ago. It was called Windows Home Server, and it was an effort to expand Microsoft&#8217;s home operating systems beyond just PCs. Windows Home Server was, in my opinion, a genius product that didn&#8217;t have an audience. The idea of a very simple to set up and effectively forgettable PC with lots of storage somewhere down in the basement or the attic where the entire family backs up their important data and stores less important data is simply an excellent idea &#8211; but an idea that nobody wants. It&#8217;s boring, people just opt for cloud storage instead, and it&#8217;s yet another bag of money you have to spend on technology. I still like the idea, though. Even in the era of cloud storage, I would love to be able to buy a relatively simple PC with tons of storage that I can store my files and back-ups on. However, you can take it a step further &#8211; if friends and family you trust also have such a device, you can build a private network of &#8220;cloud&#8221; storage devices to duplicate each other&#8217;s back-ups for improved resilience and on-the-go accessibility. Everything would have to be encrypted, of course, but in such a way people could build their own little private clouds &#8211; away from the prying eyes of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others. Now, all the technologies exist to build something like that, but it would require quite a bit of technical knowledge and active maintenance, and is anything but easy. If plug-and-play boxes existed that did this &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to buy a few and set them up at our home and those of my parents and parents-in-law.

## Pluralistic: The Lost Cause prologue (part 2) (07 Oct 2023)

date: 2023-10-07

Today's links The Lost Cause prologue (part 2): It's a small world, after all. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading The Lost Cause prologue (part 2) (permalink) My next novel is The Lost Cause, out on November 14; it's a hopeful tale of the fights we'll face after we address the polycrisis. Bill McKibben called it "The first great YIMBY novel": https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865939/the-lost-cause[121] As with my other books, I've had to produce my own audiobook for this one. Amazon won't carry any of my audio, so I make my own and pre-sell them through Kickstarter, along with ebooks and hardcovers (including signed, personalized hardcovers). The Kickstarter's going really well, and there's still time to back it: http://lost-cause.org[122] Yesterday, I kicked off a serialization of the book's prologue, which jumps straight into the action: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/06/green-new-deal-fic/#the-first-generation-in-a-century-not-to-fear-the-future[123] And now, here's part two: He was so surprised he fumbled the sledge, then squinted at me. I held the flash under my chin, squinting. “It’s me. Brooks. Palazzo. Richard’s grandson.” That was when the siren blatted down on Verdugo, blatt blatt, two toots, and a crackle of PA. “On the roof, this is Burbank PD.” He did drop the sledge then, said, “Fuck,” and produced a water pistol from the suit’s marsupial pouch. He handled it with extreme care, shedding a glove to delicately peel away a big blob of some kind of plastic or wax over the business end. His hand shook. I knew what it was. Hydrochloric acid. It was the weapon of choice for one-­on-­one white nationalist killings. It worked great, because even if you didn’t kill your victim, you’d leave them with skin melted and fused like cascades of melted rubber, a reminder to everyone who saw them that even if President Uwayni took away everyone’s guns, the American resistance was still armed and fucking dangerous. Gramps and his buddies would sometimes make jokes about Medicare for All, and how it was gonna go broke paying for acid burns when the big one came. I’d always found those jokes incredibly gross, but I learned to tune them out. They were coming back to me now. I took a step back and his hand jerked and I cried out, flinching in anticipation of the stream of acid that didn’t come. “Dammit, boy, don’t scare me. I don’t want to hurt you.” “I don’t want to be hurt. Mr. Kennedy—­Mike—­you know my gramps. He relies on me. He’s getting old and frail. I’m all he has.” I was crying now. A drop of clear liquid fell from the squirt gun’s business end and sizzled on the roof. I whimpered. “Please. Just put that down, we’ll go get the cops and—­” “I’m not going anywhere. Listen, kid, turn off your camera, okay? I gotta say some things to you.” “Mike, please—­” I was crying harder now. His hand was really shaking, and his finger was on the trigger, and the gun was pointed right at my face. “Just do it, okay?” He pointed the gun at the ground, and I found I could breathe again. I pretended to turn off my screen and triggered the sound file I had of the “Recording paused” announcement. “All right, kid. Straight talk. I don’t expect to survive this. I knew that was a chance from the start, and it was a sure thing once you got here and sounded the alarm. I made my peace with that possibility a long time ago.” He took some deep breaths that the voice-­ shifter made into the sound of a wind tunnel. He pulled the ghillie suit’s mask down and exposed the rest of his face. His lips and chin were shiny with wet sweat in the reflected flashlight beam bouncing up from the roof. “God dammit, I’m not gonna kid you, this is a stupid thing to die over, but I was gonna die eventually. But you don’t have to. You can get out of this in one piece. You can carry on the struggle.” His real voice was hoarse with emotion. Something about his real voice and his real face made me more scared, not less. Gramps’s friends were usually just . . . ​sour. But there was often this undercurrent of violence in them, a bowstring tension that sometimes snapped. Usually that just meant yelling or throwing something or storming out and slamming the door so hard the whole house shook. But every now and then, it turned into punches, and everyone in the room would pull the fighting men apart, and once or twice there had been blood on the floor before they were separated. I had never been in a fight, not since grade school anyway, and had never thrown a real punch. I found the idea of punching someone literally unimaginable. But I was finding it incredibly easy to vividly imagine this guy punching me. “Mike, you don’t have to die, we can talk to the cops. This is Burbank PD, not LAPD. They’ll negotiate. They’re not gonna shoot you. Not if you don’t give them a reason to. Why don’t you put down—­” The roof was flooded with blinding light and the roar of a quadrotor as a BPD drone rose up over us, floodlights set to max. We both staggered back, hair blowing in the rotor wash, and squinted. Mike involuntarily squirted a small stream of acid that arced over the roof, then got his gun under control. “THIS IS THE BURBANK POLICE DEPARTMENT. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS AND LACE YOUR HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD. COMPLY IMMEDIATELY.” He swore fiercely and pointed his gun at the drone. “No!” I shouted. “Jesus, Mike, do you want to fucking die?” He stared at me. His eyes were wild and unhinged. His mouth worked soundlessly, and then he shouted, “What the fuck does it matter to you?” “Because—­” I almost said, Because I want to fight on your side and we need you. I could have sold the line, even though I didn’t believe it. Even though he was a terrorist kook whose cause was both idiotic and terrible. I could have sold it because I’m a good actor, even by Burbank standards, where the star of the school play might be moonlighting from their job as an A-­lister for one of the studios. But I didn’t say it. I didn’t want to lie to this guy. “Because there’s enough stupid death out there. Because I don’t want to explain to Gramps how I saw his poker buddy blown away by BPD on my high-­school roof. Because it’s a stupid way to die. Because it won’t accomplish a goddamned thing.” I found that I was angry. God, why did people have to be so stupid? Why was I sitting around with this idiotic person having this idiotic argument, waiting for the cops to storm the roof and maybe kill us both? “Fuck this,” I said. I stalked over to him. The drone dipped toward us, making him flinch, and I was able to grab his stupid water pistol full of acid and wrench it out of his shaking hand and send it skittering over the smashed solar panels. “There,” I said, and turned to the drone. “I’ve disarmed this goddamned idiot. Don’t shoot him. And don’t shoot me—­I’m a bystander.” The drone’s PA clicked back on. “That was really stupid, kid.” Mike looked like he wanted to cry or punch me. “This whole thing is really stupid,” I said. “But it doesn’t have to be violent, too.” “We’re coming up. Lace your hands behind your head.” Mike opened his mouth. “Just do it,” I snapped. “I just saved your fucking life, asshole. Do what the nice policewoman says.” They burst through the roof door a minute later, and we both laced our hands behind our heads. They cuffed and searched both of us, relieving Mike of a long hunting knife and what I took for hand grenades, but which turned out to be flashbangs. After patting me down and conferring, they uncuffed me and led me away from Mike, who was looking miserable and scared. They took a statement from me in the cruiser, tapped my ID to their scanner, conferred a while longer, read messages on their screens that I couldn’t see—­the cops all had polarizing privacy screens on their devices—­and finally let me go. The cop who opened the back of the cruiser for me was a big, jowly guy, someone who would have looked perfectly at home with Gramps and his pals, rocking a red trucker cap and complaining about “illegals.” But he was tender with me as he helped me up and asked me twice if I needed help getting home. I pointed out that I lived a ten-­minute walk away—­he knew that from my ID, of course—­and that I hadn’t been hurt. There had been six Burbank PD SUVs on the street when they led me down, but by the time they let me go, there were only two. The other one had Mike in the back, behind reflective windows. Even though I couldn’t see him, I could feel his eyes on me as I turned and started to walk home. It was 3:27 a.m., and I was both completely wired and completely exhausted. I let myself into Gramps’s place by the back door, made my way back to my bedroom, stripped off, and pulled the covers over me. Who was I kidding? I wasn’t going to sleep after that. I rolled over and hit my screen. I had a notification that my livestream had been archived and that I could toggle it private if I wanted to, but that it was also going to be subject to FOIA requests because I’d used the 911 option and it had gone straight to Burbank PD. I reviewed the footage. It was crazy of course—­the dark night slashed with my flashlight beam, the screen’s night-­sight flicking off and on—­but the audio was good and once things stabilized, the image was clear enough. I jumped it up to 3X and listened to Mike Kennedy in chipmunk mode spouting his crazy Maga Club garbage. Even at that speed, I picked up on stuff I’d missed, little bits of inflection and vocab, and most of all, how scared he sounded. He’d been more scared than me. I guess that made sense, because he was so sure that he was going to die. Look at it that way, I had saved his life. And as soon as I looked at it that way, I knew it was true. I had saved his life. I’d saved a man’s life the night before. A man who had been ready to kill me. Or if he hadn’t been, he’d said he was. The realization let something loose inside me and I started to yawn. I pasted a link to the video into my feed and dialed the syndication wheel all the way open because why not, it was freaky and everyone shares freaky stuff wide as possible. I tapped out a message to the Burroughs High attendance office letting them know I was going to be late for school, then I put my screen down, thumped my pillow, and, amazingly, fell asleep.

It's very easy to support in a CMS, so people tend to do it. My site has the feature.</p>
<p>There's a confusing story going around that Twitter was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-accessibility-concerns-over-removed-headlines">limiting</a> this feature, or even ignoring it.

## Long gone, DEC is still powering the world of computing

date: 2023-10-07

The VAX served DEC well throughout the &#8217;80s and into the &#8217;90s, but as the latter decade went on, DEC began to face stiff competition from UNIX vendors, particularly Sun Microsystems. DEC struggled to change with the times, and the company ultimately failed. In 1998, DEC was acquired by Compaq, and in 2001, Compaq was acquired by Hewlett-Packard. The DEC line, including the VAX/VMS system, was discontinued and faded from the market. And yet it lives on today. Here’s how. Getting a DEC Alpha machine has been on my list for a long time, but they&#8217;re in very high demand, and extremely expensive. It&#8217;s quite impressive to see DEC&#8217;s continuing legacy laid out like this.

## Thirty years ago: MS-DOS 6.00, DoubleSpace, and MultiConfig

date: 2023-10-07

In addition to several new full-screen utilities, like DEFRAG to defragment your hard disk (licensed from Symantec), MSBACKUP to efficiently backup your hard disk (also licensed from Symantec), and MSAV to check for viruses (licensed from Central Point Software), there were a number of new command-line programs, such as CHOICE, DELTREE, MOVE, MSCDEX, and SMARTDRV. But the biggest addition to MS-DOS 6.00 was a new feature called DoubleSpace (dubbed “MagicDrive” internally) that automatically compressed everything on your hard disk, providing up to “double” the amount of effective disk space – or more, or less, depending on how compressible your files were overall. Despite growing up with MS-DOS since our first computer was a 286 PC in 1990 or so, I never used any of these advanced features. I was 6-7, and just wanted to play games, basically. It&#8217;s only now that I&#8217;m much older that I actually admire the crazy things people have managed to squeeze out of &#8211; or into &#8211; DOS.

## Workshop in Rotterdam: How to Build a Bike Generator

</div>
<p>The workshop takes place on behalf of the &ldquo;House of the Future&rdquo;, a spinoff of the <a href="https://www.humanpowerplant.be/human_power_plant/about-.html">Human Power Plant project</a>. The House of the Future will bring the Human Power Plant&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.humanpowerplant.be/scenarios.html">Human Powered Neighbourhood</a>&rdquo; scenario to life in Bospolder-Tussendijken, Rotterdam, in the coming years. You can already get a taste of it at the <a href="https://menskrachtcentrale.boijmans.nl">Museum Boijmans van Beuningen&rsquo;s online exhibition</a> (in Dutch).</p>
<p>Since this community will run largely on human power, we need human power plants. Therefore, Kris De Decker and Marie Verdeil organise an open and collaborative workshop where we will build a fully working bicycle generator based on a second-hand spinning bike. You are welcome to learn, experiment, teach, and help.</p>
<p>During the workshop, we will mount a generator on the bike, build a control panel, and modify devices to run on low voltage. This bicycle generator will be specifically designed to serve as a power source in the communal workshop, so that we can use it to build more stuff we need (including more bike generators).</p>
<h2 id="programme">Programme:</h2>

## Bus sniffing the IBM 5150

date: 2023-10-06

Writing a cycle-accurate emulator for a computer system is more than just understanding all the CPU instruction timings. A computer is a complete system with peripherals, interrupts, IO bus signals, and DMA. All this comes with an array of different timings and quirks. When software like Area 5150 is written that requires perfect cycle timing, it can be a challenge to provide the level of accuracy needed for the software to function. Area 5150 in particular requires precise coordination with the CGA&#8217;s CRTC chip and timer interrupts to begin the end credits demo effect at precisely the right time.  It would be very handy then if we could somehow peek into the operation of the system while it was running and understand how all these parts interact.  As it turns out, we can! This process is typically referred to as &#8216;bus sniffing&#8217;, and there&#8217;s a lot of a technical information out there on the topic in general. Sniffing can be done on everything from ethernet networks to vending machines, and you can even bus sniff your car. This article will specifically discuss sniffing the IBM PC 5150. A very in-depth and technical article, and one that can easily lead to another weekend project.

## Thread-per-core

date: 2023-10-06

I want to address a controversy that has gripped the Rust community for the past year or so: the choice by the prominent async “runtimes” to default to multi-threaded executors that perform work-stealing to balance work dynamically among their many tasks. Some Rust users are unhappy with this decision, so unhappy that they use language I would characterize as melodramatic.  What these people advocate instead is an alternative architecture that they call “thread-per-core.” They promise that this architecture will be simultaneously more performant and easier to implement. In my view, the truth is that it may be one or the other, but not both. A very academic discussion.

## Internet culture outsider

date: 2023-10-06

```html
<p>I was in the car an hour ago, listening to an episode of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/6/23906135/today-on-the-vergecast-we-debate-what-is-a-photo-for-like-three-hours" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Vergecast</a>, and I had a sudden realization: I am a cultural outsider. An internet culture outsider to be more precise. Which is weird considering my job is to make things that live on the Internet.</p>
<p>I can't remember at which point exactly but growing up there was a moment where TV was no longer a thing at my house. We just stopped watching TV programs and that was it. For years the TV was not plugged into cable, satellite, or an antenna. It was a screen, connected to consoles and a Blu-ray or DVD player. But during that process, I slowly fell out of "mainstream" culture. I remember hearing people chatting about popular TV shows and having no clue about what they were talking about. To this day, I still don't know and am not familiar with the vast majority of TV celebrities. Because TV is not a thing in my life.</p>
<p>But the internet, it was different. I'm spending hours upon hours of my life on the internet. I work on the internet. I create content for the internet. I became an adult with the internet. And I was sure that the internet was part of "my" culture. But guess what? I was wrong.</p>
<p>Listening to the podcast I couldn't stop myself from thinking "What are these people even talking about?". They were talking about trends on social platforms and TV series on streaming services, and I had no idea what was going on. But now I do know. The mainstream culture moved over to the internet and I am, again, falling out of it. And I'm fine with that.</p>

## The UAW Extracts a Key Concession from GM

date: 2023-10-06

General Motors has agreed to let the United Auto Workers bargain on behalf of workers at its battery plants, union president Shawn Fain said in a livestream Friday afternoon. Fain also said that the strike, which counts around 25,000 UAW workers, would not expand, due to the progress that had been made so far.“I was ready to call on one of GM’s most important and biggest plants to stand up,” Fain said, referring to the union’s strike strategy, where individual plant workforces walk out. “And it was that threat that brought them to the table.”Fain was referring to an SUV manufacturing plant in Arlington, Texas. So far, the UAW has avoided striking the plants that produce the bulk of General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis’s full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, the companies' most profitable vehicles. Fain acknowledged this, saying “I’ve heard members who want to bring down the hammer strike on all the big truck plants and hit them where they hurt.” But he made it very clear that possibility remains a live option.That the UAW’s big win was including battery manufacturing under its master agreement and that the way it won was by threatening to strike the factory that assembles Suburbans, Tahoes, Yukons, and Escalades speaks to the crossroads the union and the auto industry finds themselves at.Even if the UAW and the Big Three recognize that their future lies in electrification, the union’s members and the automakers’ profits are intertwined with the popularity of massive gas-guzzlers.“GM has agreed to lay the foundation for a just transition,” Fain said, referring to the battery agreement.While the strike is over a set of “traditional” labor-relations issues like workweeks, pay, healthcare, and pensions, the UAW’s conflict with the Big Three and its wariness of the Biden administration is due to its apprehension over what an electrified auto sector looks like for its membership.Not only are foreign and non-union domestic manufacturers expanding their EV production with the help of tax credits for buyers, the Big Three are also setting up joint battery ventures — often with federal backing — in states that are notoriously difficult to unionize. Even when Big Three battery plants do unionize, the companies have disputed their workers’ ability to join the UAW’s national contract.General Motors has a battery plant operating in Ohio, with plans to build three more.  In a statement to Reuters, GM did not address Fain’s claims that it had agreed to include battery plants in its agreement with the UAW.When Ford got some $9.2 billion in Department of Energy financing to build battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee, Fain blasted the Biden administration, saying, “Not only is the federal government not using its power to turn the tide – they’re actively funding the race to the bottom with billions in public money.” He asked, “Why is Joe Biden’s administration facilitating this corporate greed with taxpayer money?”Ford said last month that it was pausing a battery plant it had planned in Michigan that had attracted fierce criticism from Republican elected officials for its proposed use of Chinese technology. Ford had agreed to a streamlined process for the plant’s workforce to unionize. The company’s chief exectuvive Jim Farley criticized the UAW, saying in a press conference last month,  "Keep in mind these battery plants don’t exist yet. They’re mostly joint ventures. They’ve not been organized by the UAW yet because the workers haven’t been hired, and won't be for many years to come."

## There’s Surprisingly Little Evidence That EVs Will Require Fewer Workers

date: 2023-10-06

When former President Donald Trump was campaigning in Michigan last week, he warned autoworkers that President Biden’s electric vehicle policies would “put an end” to their “way of life.”“Hundreds of thousands of American jobs, your jobs, will be gone forever,” he said. “By most estimates, under Biden’s electric vehicle mandate, 40% of all U.S. auto jobs will disappear.”Trump may be exaggerating, but the underlying idea, that electric vehicles require less labor to manufacture than internal combustion engine cars, is the conventional wisdom. It has been circulated for years by automakers, autoworkers, politicians, and journalists. EVs contain fewer parts, the thinking goes, so naturally they will require fewer workers. That logic seems obvious, which might be why it hasn’t received much scrutiny. But when I tried to find any research supporting it, what I found instead suggested the opposite. A number of analyses showed that electric vehicles could actually require more labor to build than gas-powered cars in the U.S., at least for the foreseeable future. There are countless news articles and studies that reiterate the point that electric vehicles “have fewer moving parts” or are “less complex” and therefore pose a threat to autoworkers’ jobs. Many cite a 2017 Ford presentation that mentioned a “30% reduction in hours per unit” as a benefit of producing EVs, or former Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, who said in 2019 the company would need to make job cuts due to its switch to EVs, which “involve some 30% less effort.” More recently, as the United Auto Workers strike has ramped up, a 2022 quote from Ford’s CEO Jim Farley that “it takes 40% less labor to make an electric car,” has been circulating.But I couldn’t find any data, research, or even further explanation backing up these figures. Part of the challenge of digging into these claims is that it’s not clear what they even refer to. Are the CEOs talking about the labor required for final assembly, like dropping in the motor and putting on the doors? Are they taking into account the production of components, like the EV battery? Where do they draw the line on what constitutes EV manufacturing?Get one great climate story in your inbox every day:Ford didn’t respond directly to my request for more information about its public estimates. Instead, spokesperson Dan Barbossa replied that if I was going to quote Farley, I needed to include his entire quote. After dropping the “40% less labor” statistic, Farley had continued, “So as a family company, we have to insource so that everyone has a role in this world. We have a whole new supply chain to fill out, in batteries and motors and electronics.”There may be more to Farley’s words than a bit of public relations fluff. His suggestion that building out new supply chains will help people find “a role” aligns with the conclusions of a study that Volkswagen’s independent Sustainability Council commissioned in 2020. It was conducted by the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering, a German research group, using Volkswagen company data, and found only minor impacts on employment due to the transition. Losses can be mitigated by “shifting to the production of new components,” it said, like the individual battery cells that make up the battery packs.One of the findings was that “employment intensity” for the final manufacturing of Volkswagen’s electric ID.3 is only 3% lower than that of the conventional Golf Mk8. The bigger gap is in the labor required to produce the individual components of each car’s drivetrain. The employment intensity of the battery system and electric motor, combined, was about 40% lower than that of the combustion engine and transmission system. Notably, the study did not include the jobs required to produce the individual battery cells which make up the battery system, because Volkswagen wasn’t producing them at the time. But a more recent analysis of the U.S. manufacturing landscape found that cell production holds the most potential for job creation, and concluded that if you account for this, the transition to EVs could actually result in significantly more jobs. Turner Cotterman, a McKinsey consultant, led the research as part of his Ph.D. in public policy and engineering at Carnegie Mellon under Associate Professor Kate Whitefoot. He sought out partnerships with U.S.-based automakers and electric vehicle component manufacturers and collected original data from nine companies on the number of hours it takes to complete more than 250 process steps. In some cases he visited the shop floors and personally gathered the data himself. In his final analysis, he also incorporated public data for an additional 78 production process steps. He used the data to model three scenarios where EV and combustion engine powertrains are produced at the average efficiency, as well as a “most efficient” case and a “least efficient” case.In every case, EV manufacturing required more hours. The conventional powertrains took 4 to 11 worker hours, while the EV powertrains took 15 to 24. “A lot of the confusion sits around, what parts are you counting in this evaluation?” Cotterman told me. “We’re saying that if you were to produce every single component in an EV in the U.S., that the total sum of those powertrain components will be higher than the equivalent ICE components.”

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Cotterman, Turner and Fuchs, Erica Renee and Whitefoot, Kate, The transition to electrified vehicles: Evaluating the labor demand of manufacturing conventional versus battery electric vehicle powertrains (June 4, 2022)</small></p><p>There are a few important caveats to the research. For one, Cotterman stressed that these are present-day numbers, and they might change as EV plants scale up and learn to be more efficient. When he looked at data from Chinese manufacturing plants, they were a lot more efficient than what he saw in the U.S. And that relates to his other point. Currently, most battery components are <em>not</em> made in the U.S.</p><p>“With so many battery components made in China and South Korea, a lot of those potential labor hours are being captured by other countries,” he said. “So it's a question of the future American manufacturing workforce — how do we value them? How many opportunities do we want to extend to them?”</p><p>Another report published in 2021 by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/ev-policy-workers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reached a similar conclusion</a>. It found that the stakes for workers in the EV transition depend largely on public policy efforts to shore up U.S. manufacturing and enhance job quality. “The real challenge is making sure U.S.-based producers can invest enough to become competitive in battery production, and claw back some of the overall sales market share they lost since the Great Recession,” Josh Bivens, chief economist at the institute, told me in an email. “These are much bigger deals than anything about the inherent production process of EVs — and they’re very amenable to policy.”</p><p>Automakers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/business/electric-vehicles-uaw-gm-ford-stellantis.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> that paying workers more would put them at a disadvantage and hinder their ability to invest in the EV transition. But in a <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/uaw-automakers-negotiations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent blog post</a>, the Economic Policy Institute argued that with the help of subsidies from President Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, automakers have “more than enough money” to invest in EVs, pay workers a fair share, and maintain healthy profits.</p><p>The IRA created a domestic manufacturing tax credit that subsidizes the production of battery cells to the tune of $35 per kilowatt-hour of capacity. It offers an additional $10 per kilowatt-hour tax credit for the domestic production of battery modules, or the process of assembling the cells into arrays that later get put into battery packs. And there’s another incentive for automakers to onshore battery production — it will help their vehicles <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credits-2023-batteries" target="_self">qualify for the IRA’s consumer tax credit</a>. </p><p>According to a <a href="https://airtable.com/apprTa03Gqc8RLdQO/shrARig7JVmgQeFtV/tblW6VrVxFRq1ukLa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">database</a> maintained by the advocacy group Climate Power, there have been about 10 EV battery manufacturing plant projects announced in the U.S. since the IRA was passed, at least some of which will produce cells.</p><p>So is the crux of the matter that EV job losses or gains all come down to batteries? Not necessarily. </p><p>Whether or not the U.S. is able to build up domestic battery production, early evidence of the EV transition in the United States shows that EVs may require more labor, even in the final assembly stages.</p><p>Anna Stefanopoulou, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan, has been investigating three manufacturing sites that used to produce conventional cars and are now producing EVs: A Tesla factory in California that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUMMI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used to be a jointly-owned facility between GM and Toyota</a> that produced Pontiacs and Corollas; a Rivian plant in Illinois that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-Star_Motors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously produced Mitsubishis</a>; and the Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, where GM transitioned from producing Chevy Sonics and Buick Veranos to electric Chevy Bolts.</p><p>Her research has not been peer reviewed or published yet, but Stefanopoulou told me that after analyzing publicly available data sources for employment and output at each plant, she found that productivity had gone down in all three cases. Each one is producing fewer vehicles per worker than they were before, meaning it’s taking more people per vehicle to produce electric cars. The California site, which has been producing EVs for the longest out of the three, showed the most dramatic change. At its peak, the GM/Toyota plant produced 80 vehicles per person per year. The Tesla plant averages 30.</p><p>Stefanopoulou believes the data reflects the nascent state of U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing. She predicts that after a decade or so, as processes become more streamlined, the commonly-held belief that EV assembly requires less labor will turn out to be correct. However, she also said that if she were to consider battery cell production, as Cotterman did, EV production on the whole could require more people.</p><p>She also stressed that her data is not conclusive, and poses many more questions. For example, she found that overall production per worker in the U.S. is falling. So does the labor intensity at the EV plants reflect something specific about those factories, or a bigger issue in U.S. manufacturing productivity? </p><p>It’s also been hard for her team to identify what was actually being produced at each plant at any given time. For example, the previous owners of the California plant did not assemble engines there, but the Tesla factory is assembling battery packs. So that might explain why productivity is so much lower now. But there are a lot of unknowns. “Over the years, they changed their patterns,” she told me. “They take the cells and assemble the pack, or occasionally they manufacture cells. So we don’t know exactly what kind of work the plants include. We know the outputs are vehicles, but what does assembly include?”</p><p>In any case, Stefanopoulou is torn about what conclusion to draw from her findings on productivity. “Sometimes I don’t know if what I will present in my paper will be good news or bad news,” she told me. “Maybe it’s good news for our people that are involved, but at the end, you know, we need to be productive also, so that we can actually lower the costs so people can afford buying electric vehicles.”</p><p>What seems clear is that whether the transition results in more jobs or fewer depends a lot on which processes you’re including, how many of them will ultimately be done domestically, and how much will get streamlined through automation and other efficiency measures. </p><p>At the same time, topline job numbers aren’t the full story. The jobs created in the EV transition will certainly not all resemble the jobs that are lost. They may not be located in the same places, or require the same set of skills. Workers are right to be worried about upheaval. </p><p>But these are things that can be managed, if automakers are willing to come to the table with workers, and vice versa. For example, when Ford negotiated the closure of its Romeo Engine Plant at the end of last year, every employee was offered either a buyout or a transfer to another facility. Barbossa, the Ford spokesperson, told me many are now working about 20 minutes away, at the Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center, building EV power units for the F-150 Lightning and hybrid powertrains for the Maverick and F-150.</p><p>I reached out to the United Autoworkers to get their thoughts on these studies, but the union did not respond to my questions. The UAW does appear to have a good handle on the stakes of battery manufacturing, however. Last week, Jim Farley of Ford provided an <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2023/09/29/Remarks%20as%20prepared%20for%20delivery.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">update on the negotiations</a>, and said that “the UAW is holding the deal hostage over the battery plants.” </p><p>Farley vowed that none of its workers will lose their jobs due to battery plants during the next contract period. “In fact, for the foreseeable future we will have to hire more workers as some workers retire, in order to keep up with demand,” he said. “We are open to working with the union on a fair deal for battery plants, but these are multi-billion investments and they have to make business sense.”</p><p><em>Read more about electric vehicles and labor:</em></p><p><a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/what-does-the-uaw-want-exactly-and-what-does-that-mean-for-electric-cars?utm_campaign=post-teaser&utm_content=jhx3vsbg" target="_blank">What the UAW Wants Exactly — and What It Means for Electric Cars</a></p>

## In 2024, America’s EV Subsidies Will Be Available Instantly

date: 2023-10-06

Starting next year, Americans will be able to get a big discount on a qualifying electric vehicle right when they buy it at the dealership, the Treasury Department announced today.It’s one of the final — and most important — tweaks made to the EV tax credits under President Joe Biden’s climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.The new program will let people instantly use the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs at purchase. In essence, buyers will transfer their tax credit to the dealership at the moment of sale, allowing dealers to give them a direct discount on the price of a vehicle, according to new Treasury Department rules.Before this, Americans couldn’t get the tax credit until they filed their taxes the following year and received their rebate from the IRS. That meant, among other things, that people couldn’t use the discount before financing the car, effectively increasing their month-to-month payment. A study published last year — coauthored by researchers from George Washington University and Volkswagen — found that Americans placed vastly more value on an immediate rebate over having to wait til next April. Poorer households and used-car buyers especially valued the instant access to a discount. The point-of-sale rebate is one of a slew of changes made by the climate law to America’s EV subsidies. In January, the law placed price caps on which cars qualify for the EV tax credits, eliminating subsidies for six-figure luxury vehicles like the Hummer EV. It also opened the $4,000 tax credit for pre-owned EVs.In April, sweeping new rules that limited the subsidies to North American-made vehicles kicked in. Check out Heatmap’s list of which EVs qualify for the $7,500 tax credit under those new rules.We’ll have to see how widely automakers and dealerships will choose to participate in the new instant-rebate program. To join the scheme, a dealership or seller will have to register with the IRS ahead of time on a new website. After someone buys an EV, the seller will receive a payment for the credit within 72 hours, according to the agency.

```html
<p>A whopping 336,000 jobs were created last month, according to the Labor Department. That figure is way higher than expected. We discuss how investors might be feeling and what it means for the Federal Reserve as continues trying to tamp down inflation. But first, there are signs of progress in the United Auto Workers strike. Then, we check in with how Europe&#8217;s smaller, independent hotels faring.</p>

## Pluralistic: Serializing the opening of "The Lost Cause" (06 Oct 2023)

date: 2023-10-06

Today's links Serializing the opening of "The Lost Cause": My novel of climate hope, out on November 14. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Serializing the opening of "The Lost Cause" (permalink) My next novel is The Lost Cause, a hopeful tale of the climate emergency, which comes out on November 14. Kim Stanley Robinson called it "an unforgettable vision of what could be": https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865939/the-lost-cause[166] I'm currently running a Kickstarter campaign to pre-sell the audiobook, which I produced and narrated myself (for complex and awful reasons, Amazon won't carry my audiobooks, see the Kickstarter campaign page for details). You can also pre-order the ebook and hardcovers, including signed and personalized copies: http://lost-cause.org[167] For the next week or so, I'm going to be serializing the prologue of the book, which gets it off to quite a spicy start. Here's part one! * * * I thought that I was being so smart I signed up for the overnight pager duty for the solar array at Burroughs High. Solar arrays don’t do anything at night. Because it’s dark. They’re not lunar arrays. Turns out I outsmarted myself. My pager app went off at 1:58 a.m., making a sound that I hadn’t heard since the training session, GNAAP GNAAP GNAAP, with those low notes that loosened your bowels offset by high notes that tightened your sphincter. I slapped around my bed for my screen and found the lights and found my underwear and a tee and then the cargo pants I wore on work duty and blinked hard and rubbed my eyes until I could think clearly enough to confirm that I was dressed, had everything that I needed, and then double-­checked the pager app to make sure that I really, actually needed to go do something about the school’s solar array at, I checked, 2:07 a.m. 2:07 a.m.! Brooks, you really outsmarted yourself. Gramps’s house had started out as a two bed/one bath, like most of the houses in Burbank, but it had been expanded with a weird addition at the back—­again, like most of the houses in Burbank—­giving it a third bedroom and a second bath. That was my room, and it had its own sliding door to the backyard, so I let myself out without waking Gramps. It was warm enough that I didn’t need a jacket, which was good because I’d forgotten to put one on. Still, there was just enough of a nip in the air that I jogged a little to get my blood going. Burbank was quiet, just the sound of the wind in the big, mature trees that lined Fairview Street, a distant freight train whistle, a car zooming down Verdugo. My breath was louder than any of them. A dog barked at me and startled me as I turned onto Verdugo, streetlit and wide and empty, too. Two minutes later, I was at Burroughs, using my student app to buzz myself into the school’s gate, then the side entrance, then the utility stairs, and then I jogged up the stairs. I was only supposed to get paged if the solar array had an error it couldn’t diagnose for itself, and that the manufacturer’s techs couldn’t diagnose from its camera feeds and other telemetry. Basically, never. Not at 2:00 a.m. 2:17 a.m. now. I wondered what the hell it could be. I opened the roof access door just in time to hear a glassy crashing sound, like a window breaking, and I froze. Someone was on the roof with me. A person, glimpsed in the corner of my eye and then lost in the darkness. Too big to be a raccoon. A person. On the roof. “Hello?” Gramps’s friends sometimes made fun of my voice. I’d hated how high-­pitched it was when I was a freshman and had dreamed of it getting deeper someday, but now I was a senior, weeks away from graduation, and I still got mistaken for a girl on gamer voice-­chats. I’d made my peace with it, except that I hadn’t entirely because I was not happy at all with how it squeaked out over that roof. “Hello?” I tried for deeper. “Someone there?” No one answered, so I took a step out onto the roof. Glass crunched under my feet. It was dark and it stayed dark when I slapped at the work-­lights switch next to the door—­they should have been tripped by the motion anyway. I found my flashlight and twisted it to wide beam and checked my feet. Smashed glass, all right, and when I swung the light around to the nearest solar bank, I saw that each panel had been methodically shattered. I took a step back toward the door, and the light beam swung up and caught the man. He was wearing a head-­to-­toe suit—­a ghillie suit, Gramps’s friends called them—­and holding a short four-­pound sledgehammer with a handle and head painted in nonreflective black that swallowed my light beam. He was coming toward me. I reflexively hit the bodycam 911 emergency switch on my screen and it sounded its “Warning, bodycam recording” alert in a warm woman’s voice that I’d chosen for its nonthreatening tone. Mostly I bodycammed when I was having an argument with someone and the calm voice was a good balance between cooling things out and satisfying California’s two-­party consent rules for recording. As he raised the hammer, I wished that I’d chosen the cop voice instead. “Wait,” I said, taking a step back. The roof access door had closed behind me. “Please.” “Shit,” the man said. He was using a voice-­shifter, either a separate unit or part of the ghillie suit. His voice was deep as a diesel engine. “Dammit, you’re just a kid.” He used the hand that wasn’t holding the hammer to flip up his nightscope goggles and peer at me. His eyes, visible in the ghillie suit’s slit, were bloodshot and wrinkled and blue. He squinted at my light and brandished the hammer. “Shit,” he said again. “Get that out of my eyes, dammit.” “Sorry,” I squeaked, and lowered the beam, casting it around. It seemed like 80 percent of the panels were ruined. Why had I said sorry? Force of habit. “Shit.” If he could say it, I could too. “Shit. What the hell are you doing, man?” “You’re recording this, kid?” “Yes. Livestreaming.” “Good, then I’ll explain. You just stay there and we won’t have a problem. I was gonna have to make a video when this was done, you’re just saving me the trouble.” He lowered the hammer and let it dangle. I thought about rushing him, but I’m not a fighter, and he was still holding the hammer. Same for turning and trying to get out the door before he could catch up with me. “Kay, listen up. This world we’re in, it’s debased. America’s been rotted from the inside. First it was immigrants. You might think I’m a racist, but I’m not. It’s not immigrants I object to. It’s illegals. You want to come to America, you come in the front door, on the terms your gracious hosts here are offering. You don’t skip the line or break in through the window. That’s what a criminal does. You let in a criminal, let ’em become citizens, soon enough they’re voting for other criminals. “You know just what I’m talking about, don’t kid yourself. The money we’re spending now? This Green New Deal? This Jobs Guarantee? These fuckin’ solar panels? Bill’s gonna come due on this. There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Chinese hoaxed us into believing in this climate garbage, then they got us to go into hock to them up to our eyeballs to buy their shiny crap, and then they’re gonna charge us interest, and our kids, and their kids, and their kids. Mortgaging their future? Shit, what future? They’re headed for debt bondage for eternity. Biblical. It’s Biblical. “All this mumbo jumbo about ‘money users’ and ‘money creators’—­it’s just word games. There’s two kinds of people in this world, and it’s not ‘money users’ and ‘money creators’—­it’s ‘makers’ and ‘takers.’ The makers create all the wealth, the takers elect politicians who confiscate it and redistribute it.” “Redistribute” came out like another f-­bomb. This was crazy, but it wasn’t unfamiliar. I’d heard versions of this conversation around Gramps’s place ever since I came to live with him, back when I was eight. More, I’d heard these specific words before. I pressed my recollections, tried to put a face to the words. All the faces in Gramps’s living room had a sameness, a whiteness, matching haircuts and the same Maga hats, faded and frayed. Who had said those words? I could bring the face to mind now, the rest of the face that went with those blue watery eyes peering out of the ghillie suit. Now, the name. Mark. Not Mark. Mike. Mike! Mike, uh. “Mike Kennedy?” Hey look at this (permalink) A Murder Story: Whatever Happened to Interoperability? https://www.theamericanconservative.com/a-murder-story-whatever-happened-to-interoperability/[168] Predictive Policing Software Terrible at Predicting Crimes https://www.wired.com/story/plainfield-geolitica-crime-predictions/[169] (h/t Slashdot) Amazon Used Secret ‘Project Nessie’ Algorithm to Raise Prices https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/amazon-used-secret-project-nessie-algorithm-to-raise-prices-6c593706[170] This day in history (permalink) #20yrsago FCC releases number-portability guidelines https://www.zdnet.com/article/fcc-issues-cell-swapping-guidelines/[171] #15yrsago US Customs: Sketching an SUV makes you a copyright infringer https://www.pressrepublican.com/news/local_news/keene-artist-had-hard-time-getting-back-into-us/article_57fca386-b99e-5b24-92c1-4358eb4d74ff.html[172] #15yrsago Canadian Conservative Party pledge to reintroduce the DMCA if elected https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2008/10/conservatives-to-reintroduce-c-61/[173] #15yrsago Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China — amazing memoir by American-born Chinese journalist https://memex.craphound.com/2008/10/07/factory-girls-from-village-to-city-in-a-changing-china-amazing-memoir-by-american-born-chinese-journalist/[174] #10yrsago NSA freedom of information requests up 1000% post-Snowden https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/oct/07/nsa-inundated-foia-requests-after-snowden-leaks/[175] #10yrsago Harvard Business Review to universities: your subscription doesn’t include classroom use https://digitopoly.org/2013/10/06/harvard-business-school-publishing-crosses-the-evil-academic-line/[176] #5yrsago Using “forensic architecture” to punch Greek Nazis…in court https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/the-murder-of-pavlos-fyssas[177] #5yrsago Texas cops seize lawn-sign depicting GOP elephant as sexual predator https://www.texastribune.org/2018/10/06/police-seize-texas-political-yard-sign-gop-elephant-girl-skirt/[178] #1yrago "Don't spy on a privacy lab" (and other career advice for university provosts) https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/07/sensory-deprivation/#sensorship[179] Colophon (permalink) Today's top sources: Currently writing: A Little Brother short story about DIY insulin PLANNING Picks and Shovels, a Martin Hench noir thriller about the heroic era of the PC.

## The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Must Know About Unicode in 2023

date: 2023-10-06

Nikita Prokopov (Hacker News): The problem is, you don&#8217;t want to operate on code points. A code point is not a unit of writing; one code point is not always a single character. What you should be iterating on is called &#8220;extended grapheme clusters&#8221;, or graphemes for short.[&#8230;]Even in the widest encoding, UTF-32, &#x1F468;&#x200D;&#x1F3ED; will [&#8230;]

## Skimmer

date: 2023-10-06

I have a problem. I like to read my feeds in newsboat but I can't seem to get it working on a few machines I use. I miss having access to read feeds. Additionally there are times I would like to read my feeds in the same way I read twtxt feeds using yarnc timeline | less -R. Just get a list of all items in reverse chronological order.

I am not interested in reinventing newsboat, it does a really good job, but I do want an option where newsboat isn't available or is not not convenient to use.  This lead me to think about an experiment I am calling skimmer . Something that works with RSS, Atom and jsonfeeds in the same way I use yarnc timeline | less -R.
I'm also inspired by Dave Winer's a river of news site and his outline tooling. But in this case I don't want an output style output, just a simple list of items in reverse chronological order. I'm thinking of a more ephemeral experience in reading.

This has left me with some questions.

* How simple is would it be to write skimmer?
* How much effort would be required to maintain it?
* Could this tool incorporate support for other feed types, e.g. twtxt, Gopher, Gemini?

There is a Go package called gofeed[211]. The README describes it as a "universal" feed reading parser. That seems like a good starting point and picking a very narrowly focus task seems like a way to keep the experiment simple to implement. ...

<p>Fast and cheap transportation props up industrial societies, both for the moving of people and cargo. However, our transport networks are very wasteful of energy and utterly dependent on fossil fuels. In this series of articles, Low-tech Magazine critically examines the call for electrified vehicles, which depend on unsustainable batteries and infrastructures.</p>
<p>Much more important than the chosen power source is vehicle design: size, weight, speed, acceleration, and comfort level. Furthermore, public transport is more resource efficient, and we could electrify it without batteries.</p>
<p>The book&rsquo;s second part deals with long-distance transportation: planes, trains, sailing ships, and ocean liners. By placing transportation technology in a historical context, Low-tech Magazine challenges our high-tech approach to sustainability and highlights the possibilities of alternative solutions.</p>

## Fall Colors Are Getting Weird

date: 2023-10-05

Discussing fall foliage with the experts can make you feel a little like you’re on an episode of Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?

```html
</p><p style="">
    “The leaves change color — you remember this from elementary school — because of chlorophyll,” Kyle Cotner, the creator of <a href="https://thefoliagereport.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Foliage Report</a>, said to me, demonstrating outsized confidence in my grade-school recall. “If you remember back to an art class,” Dr. Howard Neufeld, a professor of biology at Appalachian State University who’s also known as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FallColorGuy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fall Color Guy</a>, prompted me later, “if you have a <em>red</em> pigment, what’s its <em>complementary color</em>?” (Folks, it’s not “blue” — it’s green.)
</p><p style="">
    But while the autumn portion of the tree life cycle may be a staple of primary school pop quizzes, it’s also a dizzyingly complicated phenomenon and one that’s been behaving … well, <em>oddly</em>. “There’s much less overall consistency and pattern,” Dr. John O’Keefe, the lead phenology scientist at <a href="https://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Harvard Forest</a>, told me of the fall color he’s been seeing recently. “It’s just bigger extremes. And that’s, of course, one of the things that climate change is causing: wilder swings.”
</p><p>
    Neufeld, who works out of North Carolina, has seen the same thing in his neck of the woods. Looking back over his 17 years of data recently, he noticed that “the peak color was always the same time of year: the 10th to the 20th of October,” he told me. But “starting in 2017, it’s all over the place.” Sometimes the peak colors would come two weeks late; other times it’d be early, or arrive on time. “As a biostatistician, I went back and I calculated how variable the timing was. And it’s <em>twice</em> as variable in these recent years as it is in the first eight years,” he said.
</p><p>
    Neufeld stressed that his observations are not statistically significant yet, but he suspects that in a few more years, and with a few more data points, they will be. “My suspicion is that it’s the beginning of a climate change effect,” he said.
</p><p>
    This sort of unpredictability is especially worrying because leaf peeping is estimated by Neufeld to be <a href="https://biology.appstate.edu/fall-colors/economics-fall-foliage-tourism-north-carolina" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a $25 to $30 <em>billion</em> industry</a> in the eastern U.S. alone during a strong fall color year. The number of fluctuating variables — from rainfall to temperature to cloud cover to fungi to one badly timed windstorm — can leave the towns and people who rely on autumn tourism <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/08/23/foliage-fall-destinations-extreme-weather/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">feeling destabilized.</a> <em>Will this year be a good year? Will it not be, and word will get out, suppressing the crowds?</em>
</p><p style="">
    If there were ever a year for climate change to be impacting fall colors, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/counties-extreme-weather-alerts" target="_self">it’d be this one</a>. But the precise reason came as some surprise. It’s not the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/september-2023-hottest-heat-zeke-hauffather" target="_self">late heat</a>, but the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/vermont-rain-storm-flooding-climate" target="_self">abnormal amount of rain</a> that’s been the more significant variable at a local level. As Neufeld pointed out, “September was the warmest on record — but not in North Carolina and especially not in the mountains.”</p><p style="">
    That precipitation, which is also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/10/11/rain-increasing-climate-change-us/" target="_blank">more likely because of climate change</a>, has been both a boon and a bust for fall color. “With so much rain, the colors will not be as vibrant [in the northeast],” said Cotner, who tracks the trends nationally. “I’ve noticed places like Stowe, Vermont, are much duller this season and turning brown … I can tell you, I’m truly disappointed with the region compared to last year.”
</p><p style="">
    But at the same time, the rainy trends in the Western United States have pulled the region out of its drought and created “probably the best [fall color] year in a decade,” Cotner went on, “especially the three all-star states: Colorado, Utah, California. Utah probably wins.”
</p><center><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet" data-partner="rebelmouse" data-twitter-tweet-id="1708884752885748056">
<div style="margin:1em 0">One of the most underrated fall foliage states.</div> — The Foliage Report (@The Foliage Report)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/FoliageReport/status/1708884752885748056">1696264849</a>
</blockquote>
<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></center><p style="">	While the main theme of fall leaves has been to expect the unexpected, it’s also true that “there is a slight trend toward [peak color] getting later over the 30 years that I’ve been watching,” O’Keefe, in Massachusetts, noted. It’s an observation that tracks with the greater climate research: Between 1952 and 2011, fall <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL091753" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decreased from 87 days to 82 days</a>, chipped away at by the lengthening summer. In general, “sunny days and cooler, crisp nights are when we develop the brightest colors,” O’Keefe said, but fall temperatures have increased on average by 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit across the U.S. since 1970, <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/2022-fall-package" target="_blank">Climate Central reports</a>, and by as much as 4.5 degrees in parts of Vermont.</p><p style="">Of course, there’s more in jeopardy than tourism and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/style/christian-girl-autumn-caitlin-covington.html" target="_blank">Caitlin Covington’s Instagram content</a>. Should the weird fall weather continue, then the actual makeup of the fall scenery could also start to change. Less hardy trees of one color might be beaten out by more competitive trees of another. Southern trees could <a href="https://heatmap.news/is-native-gardening-becoming-pointless" target="_blank">begin to move north</a>, and northern trees could retreat into Canada, or uphill to cooler elevations. Spectacular orange-and-yellow-and-red hillsides might become more monochromatic. When the forest ecologies change, the autumn landscapes will change in turn. Leaf peepers are just witnessing the aftermath.</p><p style="">But remember those brilliant 5th graders? They’ve got a part in all this, too. Fall colors “get more people out seeing nature than almost any other time of the year,” Nuefeld said. “So I'm hoping that when people go out and see them, they have a better appreciation of nature and want to do something to preserve it, so that their kids can go out when <em>they’re</em> their age to see the full color, too.”</p>

## P&B: Andrea Contino

date: 2023-10-05

```html
<p>This is the 6th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Andrea Contino and his blog, <a href="https://gwtf.it" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">gwtf.it</a>.</p>
<p>Andrea is currently working as Head of Communications at Red Bull Italy but he's about to move west and work as Senior Communications Manager at Red Bull North America.</p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&#039;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>While I'm writing this I'm the Head of Comms in Red Bull Italy. But soon Sr. Comms Manager Gaming in Red Bull North America! I've a humanistic background since I've studied foreign languages at the high school and I've a degree in Communications Sciences. I ended up doing this job most likely having a blog and living the early 2000's online communities. No jokes. </p>
<p>I was writing for an online Italian video games newsite while finishing my University studies and I ended up talking about the interactions within those online forum communities in my final degree dissertation. From there I've started to build up my network, It was 2006 and blogs were at their peak, who had one was a so-called influencer. I opened mine in 2007, we were the forerunners of what people do on Instagram and TikTok nowadays, luckily without any dancing, but with sometimes raw content and transparency at its best. </p>
<p>I got in touch with many people and companies which through my blog got to know me better and better and at the same time I started working for Microsoft so my personal and professional life started to collide, exploding then in the marvellous adventure I'm living nowadays.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&#039;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I've opened my blog, as said, in 2007. The occasion was a press trip to Canada for EA Sports. I needed to cover the new FIFA game and I was thinking it would have been a nice starting point. I'm not a developer, I've no programming background, therefore I've picked an unknown platform at that time: SquareSpace.</p>
<p>My blog was called Fluxes and I came up with this name after days of thinking about what could have possibly been the best name for a blog. I ended up with fluxes as a stream of consciousness and thoughts. But I was never satisfied with my blog, never. So I kept changing over the years. First I've moved to the contino.com domain, and renamed my blog to AC. Then I bought the domain andrea.co and redirected the blog there. I finally moved it to the actual domain, gwtf.it and renamed it Go With The Flow, which is my life philosophy and more coherent to what I am. Unfortunately I tried WordPress for a little while in 2021 just to find out that it wasn't the platform for me and wasting a lot of money to keep it alive (300$ per year), I was back to SquareSpace from 2022 onward. Tried Medium for a little while, but back home to SquareSpace definitively.</p>
<p>Downside of that? I've lost a lot of readership. Honestly I don't care. But if there is a learning behind those movements, I can suggest anyone who has a blog not to change platforms after some years if not really necessary. <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/absolutely-do-not-change-your-blogging-platform-unless-you-have-to/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">I tend to agree with Matt here</a>.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Usually inspiration comes from both online and offline. Online I stick to my feed reader, feedly, where I find some good pieces of writing to start thinking on. From what I found super stimulating I start thinking what kind of thoughts I can add to other's. I open my draft and start to write without overthinking too much about form or grammar. After finishing my post, I go through it and adjust what needs to be adjusted. Hit publish and never look back.</p>
<p>For what is coming from offline I usually like to speak about 3 things: food, travelling, personal experiences. It's an absolute pleasure to put down your thoughts and save publicly somewhere. They could help somebody else one day. I'll never know.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Usually sitting at my desk in my home office. It's where I think I've the right environment and quietness to express at my best. But I've written some of my best posts while on the metro train or sitting under the shades at the beach. Another thing not to underestimate for me is those minutes before I fall asleep. Usually for me is a time to think and where many blog post ideas came from. That's why I've a cheap old android phone with just wifi enabled standing at my bedside table, always ready to receive my inputs.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I tried all the possible combinations here. Hosted, 3rd party platform, different CMSs.  Now I'm using Squarespace as a 3rd party platform which hosts my blog. My domain gwtf.itis actually registered with Google Domains (only because Porkbun is not able to register .it domains, otherwise I firmly suggest them) which funny enough will end up to be acquired by SquareSpace in the near future LOL.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Yes. I would start with WordPress and not SquareSpace. I mean if it was 2007 again. Otherwise nowadays I would rather go with Ghost or a static blog, like Jekyll or something like that. Because WordPress has become a pain in the ass when it comes to plug-ins or this or that feature. All they want is for you to pay more, hiding behind the free software flag. I've always loved SquareSpace, but it became a Marketing platform lately. They completely left behind their blogging promise and I found several bugs in the mobile app, but support is great and they fix things quickly. The other thing I would do differently is to study a little bit better the HTML and CSS foundations in order to be able to develop my blog all by myself.<br />
But, I've seen a lot of new platforms flourish lately and I've tried to collect some of those for the younger generations <a href="https://gwtf.it/blog/2023/7/20/continua-a-scrivere" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a></p></div> 
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>My blog costs me nothing. I won a contest several years ago with Squarespace. So I don’t pay a penny to have it hosted there. I just pay 12€ yearly for the domain. Not that bad!</p>
<p>Generally I've always avoided having ads on my blog, I don't like it and I never want them to be on my site. I've monetised my blog in the past through product testing, mostly food, but I've always refused to write sponsored posts. I generally hate those important bloggers that do that. I personally think it's disrespectful for their readers community.</p>
<p>That said I totally empathize with those fellow bloggers who succeeded in blogging for a living. I totally respect them in any shape or form, but I'd rather prefer they ask for support and tips for what they create. Well if you want to leave me a tip, it's really appreciated :&#41; <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/contz" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">PayPal.Me</a></p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I'm a techie and a geek. So my RSS Feed is full of those kinds of blogs. Here is my top 3 suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://morrick.me" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Riccardo Mori</a></li>
<li><a href="https://birchtree.me/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Matt Birchler</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Ben Thompson</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I really think Matt would be a great one to have as a next interviewer.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Well some cool stuff I've collected here and there during my life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book: <a href="https://www.lukerhinehart.net/books/dice-man/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The Dice Man by Luke Rhinehart</a></li>

An estimated 20,000 to 30,000 climbers attempt a summit of France’s Mont Blanc each year — a task that will be slightly easier in 2023, as the mountain’s peak has shrunk by more than 2.2 meters, or over seven feet, the equivalent of NBA star Victor Wembanyama, since 2021. Measurements of its height have been taken every two years since 2001 to assess the impact of climate change on the Alps, and this year’s measurement struck surveyor Denis Borel as “somewhat exceptional.” The shrinkage was “quite considerable compared to the measurements of previous eras,” he told French television channel TF1.Mont Blanc is sheathed in a cap of ice, which shrinks in warmer, drier years, and grows in colder, wetter years. Depending on future precipitation, “Mont Blanc could well be much taller in two years,” according to Jean des Garets, the area’s chief surveyor. However, since 2013, when the mountain reached a height of 4,810.02 meters, its peak has steadily declined. “It is hard to believe we are going to recuperate a few meters over the next two years. There is a lot of variation, but there is a slight downward trend,” Farouk Kadded of Leica Geosystems said. “Normally, Mont Blanc gains one meter from June to September, but that did not happen this summer because [of] several days of positive temperatures, even a record of 10 degrees Celsius.” Though des Garets said that the team was “gathering the data for future generations; we’re not here to interpret them,” it seems that the iconic mountain's decline is yet one more effect of recent months’ disturbingly — some might say gobsmackingly bananas — warm temperatures.

## A Hotter World is Turbocharging Our Electricity Use

date: 2023-10-05

It’s getting hotter. And when it gets really hot, everyone uses more electricity, much of which comes from fossil fuels. This is a basic dilemma facing much of the world thanks to climate change, with the United States very, very much included.According to data from the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. had its second highest demand for electricity in a given hour this past summer, with 741,815 megawatt-hours on the grid on July 27, 2023. Temperatures were as high as 125 degrees in Death Valley that day, with local highs of 95 degrees in New York City, 94 degrees in Houston, and 96 degrees in Los Angeles. Total electricity demand was also only 889 megawatt-hours short of the record set on July 20, 2022.Annual demand peaked last year with just over 4 trillion megawatt-hours of electricity consumed across the country, according to EIA data. That record will surely be broken in the coming years. Indeed, several electric grids had all-time usage records this past summer, including Texas’s ERCOT and several grids in Arizona.Overall consumption will likely continue to rise, not just because of more demand for air conditioning in a warming world, but because of the policy response to warming, namely electrification. To get away from burning fossil fuels for power and heat, more cars will run off batteries and more homes will be heated and cooled with heat pumps.All this, along with population growth, economic growth, and increased industrialization to build the renewable energy components, cars, and semiconductors policymakers want to bring back onshore, poses quite the challenge to those tasked with reducing emissions. Climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels for energy, yet our energy consumption will rise in response to climate change. The fast deployment of tremendous amounts of non-carbon-emitting energy is the only way to deal with the effects of global warming without making the problem worse.

## Pluralistic: Union pensions are funding private equity attacks on workers (05 Oct 2023)

date: 2023-10-05

Today's links Union pensions are funding private equity attacks on workers: When your pension fund comes for your job, your home, and your funeral. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2013, 2018 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Union pensions are funding private equity attacks on workers (permalink) If end-stage capitalism has a motto, it's this: "Stop hitting yourself." The great failure of "voting with your wallet" is that you're casting ballots in a one party system (The Capitalism Party), and the people with the thickest wallets get the most votes. During the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese state would bill the families of executed dissidents for the ammunition used to execute their loved ones: https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-the-Chinese-government-makes-the-families-of-executed-people-pay-for-the-cost-of-bullets[212] In end-stage capitalism, the dollars we spend to feed ourselves are used to capture the food supply and corrupt our political process: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy[213] And the dollars we save for retirement are flushed into the stock market casino, a game that is rigged against us, where we are always the suckers at the table: https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/25/derechos-humanos/#are-there-no-poorhouses[214] Everywhere and always, we are financing our own destruction. It's quite a Mr Gotcha moment: https://thenib.com/mister-gotcha/[215] Now, anything that can't go on forever will eventually stop. We are living through a broad, multi-front counter-revolution to Reaganomics and neoliberal Democratic Party sellouts. The FTC and DOJ Antitrust Division are dragging Big Tech and Big Meat and Big Publishing into court. We're seeing bans on noncompete clauses, and high-profile government enforcers are publicly pledging never to work for corporate law-firms when they quit public service: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/09/nein-nein/#everything-is-miscellaneous[216] And of course, there's the reinvigoration of the labor movement! Hot Labor Summer is now Perpetual Labor September, with 75,000 Kaiser workers walking out alongside the UAW, SAG-AFTRA and 2,350 other groups of workers picketing, striking or protesting: https://striketracker.ilr.cornell.edu/[217] But capitalism still gets a lick in. Union pension plans are some of the most important investors in private equity funds. Your union pension dollars are probably funding the union-busting, child-labor-employing, civilization-destroying Gordon Gecko LARPers who are also evicting you from the rental they bought and turned into a slum, and will then murder you in a hospice that they bought and turned into a slaughterhouse: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/26/death-panels/#what-the-heck-is-going-on-with-CMS[218] Writing for The American Prospect, Rachel Phua rounds up the past, present and future of union pension funds backing private equity monsters: https://prospect.org/labor/2023-10-04-workers-funding-misery-private-equity-pension-funds/[219] Private equity and hedge funds have destroyed 1.3 million US jobs: https://united4respect.org/press-release/people-who-work-at-walmart-sears-amazon-formerly-toys-r-us-more-join-forces-together-as-united-for-respect-2-2-2-2-5-3/[220] They buy companies and then illegally staff them with children: https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20230217-1[221] They lobby against the minimum wage: https://pestakeholder.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Insire-Brands-memo-on-15-wage.pdf[222] They illegally retaliate against workers seeking to unionize their jobsite: https://www.hoteldive.com/news/dc-hotel-workers-enlist-us-representatives-to-fight-sofitel-union-busting/650396/[223] And they couldn't do it without union pension funds. Public service union pensions have invested $650 million with PE funds. In 2001, the share of public union pensions invested in PE was 3.5%; today, it's 13%: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B0vv26VEFmwtfw5ur6dSDMY8NftvZKij/[224] Giant public union funds like CalPERS are planning massive increases in their contributions to PE: https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/newsroom/calpers-news/2023/calpers-preliminary-investment-return-fiscal-year-2022-23[225] This results in some ghastly and ironic situations. Aramark used funds from a custodian's union to bid against that union's members for contracts, in an attempt to break the union and force the workers to take a paycut to $11/hour: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-11-20/pension-fund-gains-mean-worker-pain-as-aramark-cuts-pay[226] Blackstone's investors include the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS). The PE ghouls who sucked Toys R Us dry were funded by Texas teachers. Then there's KKR, one of the most rapacious predators of the PE world. Half of the investors in KKR's Global Infrastructure Investors IV fund are public sector pension funds. Those workers' money were spent to buy up Refresco (Arizona Iced Tea, Tropicana juices, etc), a transaction that immediately precipitated a huge spike in on-the-job accidents as KKR cut safety and increased tempo: https://www.osha.gov/ords/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=1675674.015[227] Petsmart is the poster-child for PE predation. The company uses TRAPs ("TrainingRepaymentAgreementProvision") clauses to recreate indentured servitude, forcing workers to pay thousands of dollars to quit their jobs: https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose[228] Why would a Petsmart employee want to quit? Petsmart's PE owner is BC Partners, and under BC's management, workers have been forced to work impossible hours while overseeing cruel animal abuse, including starving sick animals to death rather than euthanizing them, and then being made to sneak them into dumpsters on the way home from work so Petsmart doesn't have to pay for cremation. 24 of BC Partners' backers are public pension funds, including CalSTRS and the NYC Employees' Retirement System: https://prospect.org/culture/books/2023-06-02-days-of-plunder-morgenson-rosner-ballou-review/[229] PE buyouts are immediately followed by layoffs. One in five PE acquisitions goes bankrupt. Unions should not be investing in PE. But the managers of these funds defend the practice, saying they "facilitate dialog" with the PE bosses on workers' behalf. This isn't total nonsense. Once upon a time, public pension fund managers put pressure on investees to force them to divest from Apartheid South Africa and tobacco companies. Even today, public pensions have successfully applied leverage to get fund managers to drop Russian investments after the invasion of Ukraine. And public pensions pulled out of the private prison sector, tanking the valuation of some of the largest players. But there's no evidence that this leverage is being applied to pensions' PE billions. It's not like PE is a great deal for these pensions. PE funds don't reliably outperform the market, especially after PE bosses' sky-high fees are clawed back: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3623820[230] Pension funds could match or beat their PE returns by sticking the money in a low-load Vanguard index tracker. What's more, PE is getting worse, pioneering new scams like inflating the value of companies after they buy and strip-mine them, even though there's no reason to think anyone would buy these hollow companies at the price that the PE companies assign to them for bookkeeping purposes: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2bstqfcskz9o72ospzlds/opinion/why-does-private-equity-get-to-play-make-believe-with-prices[231] To inject a little verisimilitude into this obvious fantasy, PE companies sell their portfolio companies to themselves at inflated prices, in a patently fraudulent shell-game: https://www.ft.com/content/646d00f4-af5d-4267-a436-54fb3bc1697b[232] What's more, PE funds aren't just bad bosses, they're also bad landlords. PE-backed funds have scooped up an appreciable fraction of America's housing stock, transforming good rentals into slums: https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/27/extraordinary-popular-delusions/#wall-street-slumlords[233] PE is really pioneering a literal cradle-to-grave immiseration strategy. First, they gouge you on your kids' birth: https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/27/crossing-a-line/#zero-fucks-given[234] Then, they slash your wages and steal from your paycheck: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3465723[235] Then, they evict you from your home: https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/05/vulture-capitalism/#distressed-assets[236] And then they murder you as part of a scam they're running on Medicare: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/05/any-metric-becomes-a-target/#hca[237] As the labor movement flexes its muscle, it needs to break this connection. Workers should not be paying for the bullet that their bosses put through their skulls.

## Kevin McCarthy Couldn’t Save Himself. But He Still Might Save the Sequoias.

date: 2023-10-04

The environmental movement likely won’t be missing Kevin McCarthy much.His Bakersfield-based district is one of the centers of the California oil industry. The first major bill his House majority voted for would have scrapped a multi-billion dollar fund for clean energy investments in disadvantaged communities. He often took the side of agricultural interests in the Central Valley against environmentalists when it came to water policy. Environmentalist groups like Earthjustice and the Sierra Club have been criticizing him for literally more than a decade. The McCarthy-run House of Representatives passed bills (never turned into law) that would have undone swathes of the Inflation Reduction Act’s climate provisions and eased fossil fuel development.But he has a thing for trees. The speaker of the House typically doesn’t directly sponsor much legislation, so it was noteworthy when McCarthy introduced a bill on Arbor Day with a fleet of Republican and Democratic co-sponsors, especially from his home state of California, called the Save Our Sequoias Act. McCarthy’s district doesn’t just include some of California’s oil industry, but also Sequoia National Park, which contains the massive General Sherman Tree, which stretches 275 feet into the air from a 36-foot diameter base.The bill, which McCarthy introduced in 2022 as well, would codify existing relationships between different governments to protect the trees, fund a grant program to remove fuel — dry leaves, fallen branches, etc — around the trees, make it easier for private donors to fund programs for the trees, and allow projects to protect the trees to circumvent the usual environmental permitting process.Get one great climate story in your inbox every day:It was this last part that provoked many prominent environmental groups to oppose the bill, including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthjustice, and the League of Conservation Voters. When the bill was introduced earlier this year, an Earthjustice official called it “a misguided solution in search of a problem that could set a dangerous precedent for gutting environmental laws.”The coalition formed to support the bill was a collection of industry groups, including those representing the logging industry and the Chamber of Commerce, free market or conservative environmentalist groups like the Property and Environment Research Center and American Conservation Coalition Action, as well as local statewide governments and conservation groups in California.In other words, it’s what it looks like when a Republican tries to pass a conservation bill: a combination of intense local interest and trying to bring on as many of the party’s traditional business partners as possible.The bill also had the influential co-sponsorship of Bruce Westerman, the Republican congressman from Arkansas who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources. “Our priorities remain unchanged,” Rebekah Hoshiko, the committee’s communications director, told me in an email. “The Save Our Sequoias Act already passed out of committee and has overwhelmingly bipartisan support, and we will continue to advocate for it and our many other bills as they move through the legislative process.”  The bill currently sits with the House Agriculture Committee.Groups that focus on conserving these massive trees hope the bill will survive. The Save the Redwoods League told me in a statement that it is “optimistic about the opportunity that the Save Our Sequoias Act presents.”For conservatives interested in climate change and conservation policy, the bill was an example of what they see as potential for other House leaders to craft bipartisan legislation. Stephen Perkins, the chief operating officer of the American Conservation Coalition Action, described the bill as “conservation policy that’s also climate action.”The Save Our Sequoias Act, Perkins said, was able to attract a bipartisan coalition because, for Democrats, it presented both a conservation and climate win — “wildfires and forest management play a direct role in keeping emissions in line and keeping emissions goals” — while, for industry and conservative groups, “it’s about keeping communities functioning and state economies in a good place.”And it also may present a kind of framework for another area of potential bipartisan overlap that McCarthy had shown some openness too: permitting reform. The exception carved out of environmental regulations for Giant Sequoia conservation was relatively small, but both Republicans and Democrats have shown some interest in a more general overhaul of federal environmental laws that, for Republicans, would limit reviews for all projects and for Democrats would hopefully make it easier to build renewable energy and especially transmission infrastructure. And McCarthy's own district doesn't just have oil in the ground, it also has energy in the sky, with windy mountain passes in the Tehachapis and the baking hot Mojave Desert. The House Republican likely to negotiate any permitting deal, Louisiana Representative Garrett Graves, has been described as McCarthy’s ”wingman.”While Perkins wouldn’t say who he or his group preferred among the crop of candidates to replace McCarthy, he did say that the “next speaker can’t ignore the opportunity to work on permitting reform,” noting that many young Republicans think the party should pay more attention to climate change.“We’re willing to work with anyone and we have worked with all of the representatives from the majority leader to the whip and so on and so forth. We’re confident that whenever a new speaker is [elected], we’ll be able to pick up conversations when we left them off with Speaker McCarthy.”

## Pluralistic: For 40 years, Big Meat has openly colluded to rig prices (04 Oct 2023)

date: 2023-10-04

Today's links For 40 years, Big Meat has openly colluded to rig prices: A long-overdue antitrust beatdown for Agri Stats. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2013, 2018 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading For 40 years, Big Meat has openly colluded to rig prices (permalink) Noted socialist agitator Adam Smith once wrote, "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the publick, or in some contrivance to raise prices." Smith was articulating a basic truth: when an industry grows concentrated, it grows cozy. Cultural differences between dominant firms are homogenized as top executives move from company to company, cross-pollinating attitudes and approaches. Ambituous, firm-hopping workaholic top brass make all their friends at the office, and so their former colleagues from one or two jobs back remain in their social circles. Once an industry consists of half a dozen firms, the people running those companies constitute an incestuous financial polycule. They are executors of one anothers' estates, best men and maids of honor at one anothers' weddings, godparents to each others' kids. They play on the same softball teams and take family vacations together. It would be heartwarming if it wasn't for the cost to the rest of us. Remember Smith's maxim: "the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the publick, or in some contrivance to raise prices." Class solidarity among corporate executives forms a united front to screw us in every conceivable way, from corrupting our politicians to maiming and cheating workers to gouging buyers. That's the basis of American antitrust law. When Robert Sherman was stumping for the passage of the Sherman Act, America's first major antitrust law, he thundered "If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity": https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/[278] Or rather, that was the basis of American antitrust law &#8211; until the Reagan era, when the fringe theories of the Nixonite criminal Robert Bork were elevated to a new orthodoxy. Under Bork's conception of antitrust, monopolies were evidence of excellence. If a company puts all its competitors out of business, that must mean that it is "efficient." In Bork's fantasy world, the only way a company could attain dominance is by being so beloved by its customers that every competitor withers away. Governments that bust monopolies aren't protecting the public from "autocrats of trade"; they're overthrowing the winners of an election where you "vote with your wallet" to pick the best company. But Bork and his co-fantasists couldn't quite manage all that with a straight face. They grudgingly admitted that a certain kind of bad monopolist could hypothetically exist, one that used its "market power" to raise prices or lower quality. Only when these offenses against our "consumer welfare" occurred should the state step in to protect its people. This may sound good in theory, but in practice, it was a dead letter. The consumer welfare test isn't as simple as "If prices go up after a merger, punish the company." Instead, the government had to prove that the price raises came from "market power," and not from an increase in energy or labor costs, or some other "exogenous factor," like Mercury being in retrograde: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/10/you-had-one-job/#thats-just-the-as[279] And wouldn't you know it, it turns out that the mathematical models prescribed to distinguish greed from unavoidable circumstance inevitably "prove" that the monopolist wasn't at fault. Surely, it's just just a coincidence that the priesthood that understood how to make and interpret these models were Chicago School Economists who sold model-making as a service to companies that wanted to raise prices. Pro-monopoly economists insist that this isn't true, and that their theory still has room to prosecute bad monopolies and cartels where they occur &#8211; more, they say this is already happening. In particular, they insist that "greedflation" can't be real, because it would require the kind of conspiracy that Smith warned of, and that their sickly antitrust enforcement is sufficient to prevent: https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power[280] This strains credulity. After all, the CEOs of giant companies in concentrated industries openly boast to their shareholders about how they've used the covid and Ukraine invasion shocks to hike prices to increase their profit margins &#8211; not just cover their additional costs: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on[281] While excuseflation is new, open, naked price-fixing by industry cartels is not. Take the meat-packing industry, dominated by a tiny handful of giant corporations whose executives literally ran a betting pool on how many of their workers would get covid each week while working in their cramped, unventilated factories: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55009228[282] These companies have seen their margins soar &#8211; up 300% over the lockdown &#8211; while their payments to ranchers and growers cratered: https://www.reuters.com/business/meat-packers-profit-margins-jumped-300-during-pandemic-white-house-economics-2021-12-10/[283] All this might leave one wondering whether there isn't something a little, you know, "conspiracy against the publick"-y going on in Big Meat? Let me tell you about Agri Stats. Agri Stats has been around since 1985. Every large meat packer pays to be a "member" of Agri Stats, and they each submit weekly, detailed statistics about every aspect of their business: all their costs, all their margins, broken out by category. Agri Stats compiles this into phone-book-thick books that each member gets every week, telling them everything about how all of their competitors are running their businesses: https://www.agristats.com/history[284] The companies whose data appears in this book are anonymized, but it's trivial to re-identify each supplier. Tyson execs hold regular "naming process" meetings where they go through new books and de-anonymize the data. A Butterball exec confirmed that he "can pick the companies for rankings with 100% certainty." As David Dayen writes in The American Prospect, these books are incredibly detailed: "bird weights, freezer inventory, and 'head killed per operating hour.'" Within the cozy meat cartels, Agri Stats acts as a clearinghouse that allows every business in the industry to act in concert, running the entire meat-packing sector as a single company: https://prospect.org/power/2023-10-03-lawsuit-highlights-why-meat-overpriced/[285] As interesting as the list of Agri Stats members is, the groups that don't get to see Agri Stats' "books" is just as important: "farmers, workers, or retailers." Agri Stats also offers consulting services to its members. As an exec at pork processor Smithfield put it, Agri Stats advice boils down to four words "Just raise your price." Agri Stats ranks its members based on how high their prices are &#8211; they literally publish a league table with the highest prices at the top. Meat packers pay bonuses to their execs based on how high the company's rank is on that table. Agri Stats meets with its members throughout the year to discuss "price opportunities" and to advise them to "exercise restraint" by restricting supply to keep prices up. When one Agri Stats member considered leaving the cartel, Agri Stats wooed them back by telling them how to make an additional $100k by raising bacon prices. The reason Dayen is writing about Agri Stats now is that the DoJ Antitrust Division has brought an antitrust suit against them. This is part of a wave of antitrust actions brought by Biden's DoJ and FTC, who, along with his NLRB, are shaping up to be the most pugnacious, public-interest force against corporate power since the Reagan administration: https://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/29124-doj-sues-agri-stats-for-complicity-in-meat-market-manipulation[286] All this enforcement isn't a coincidence. It comes from an explicit rejection of neoliberalism's core tenets: inequality reflects merit, monopolies are efficient, and government can't do anything. In Biden's DoJ, FTC and NLRB, they're partying like it's 1979: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/party-its-1979-og-antitrust-back-baby[287] What's amazing about the Agri Stats conspiracy to raise prices is that it's been going since the Reagan administration. It's a smoking gun proof that "consumer welfare" never cared about price-fixing and robbing the public (can a gun still smoke after 40 years?). There was never a time when consumer welfare antitrust cared about consumer welfare. It was always and forever a front for "a conspiracy against the publick," a "contrivance to raise prices." Big Meat has been robbing America for two generations. Some of those stolen funds were used to corrupt our political process. The meat sector gets $50 billion in public subsidies and still gouges us on prices and rips off its suppliers: https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2022/02/usda-livestock-subsidies-near-50-billion-ewg-analysis-finds[288] Which means that it's possible that we're simultaneously being ripped off with meat prices and that meat prices are artificially low. Try and wrap your head around that one! The do-nothing, pro-monopoly neoliberal antitrust is a virus that spread around the world. The EU's antitrust laws were reshaped to mirror American laws after the war through the Marshall Plan, but since the late 1970s, European lawmakers and enforcers have ignored their own laws (just like their American counterparts) and encouraged monopolies as "efficient." This Made-in-Europe oligopoly, combined with energy and grain shocks from Russian invasion of Ukraine, created the perfect storm for European greedflation. As food prices spiked across the EU, Austrian hacktivist Mario Zechner set out to investigate Austrian grocers' pricing. Using the grocers' own APIs, he was able to compile and analyze a dataset of prices at Austrian grocers: https://www.wired.com/story/heisse-preise-food-prices/[289] When Zechner open-sourced his project, collaborators showed up to expand the project across other EU countries, and an anonymous party donated a huge database of prices stretching back to 2017. The data reveals clear collusion among the grocers, who raise prices in near-lockstep, and use gimmicks like cyclic price drops to hide their collusion: https://github.com/badlogic/heissepreise[290] Not every grocer has an API, and even the ones that do have APIs could easily block Zechner and co from accessing their data. When that happens, they could &#8211; and should &#8211; turn to scraping to continue their project. They should also scrape grocers elsewhere, including in Canada, where grocers rigged the price of bread: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/25/deep-scrape/#steering-with-the-windshield-wipers[291] Because Big Meat's "conspiracy against the publick" isn't unique to meat. It's in all our food, it's in all our goods, it's in all our services. The fact that the meat industry was able to rob American buyers, ranchers and farmers for two generations under a 200' tall neon sign that blinked "AGRI STATS AGRI STATS AGRI STATS" night and day is frankly astonishing. But there's never just one ant.

## The Cabin in the Fire Zone

date: 2023-10-04

Where should you live as the planet changes? Is one place more habitable than another? This summer proved the arbitrary nature of our new climate extremes and that there is nowhere to run from extreme weather. Today, I’m starting a new interview series to explore how architects are designing buildings to be more resilient as the climate changes. Let’s begin with the Lundberg/Breuer cabin. Lundberg/Breuer cabin from Lundberg ArchitectsSince 1987, Olle Lundberg has run Lundberg Design Studio out of an old mattress factory in the industrial Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco. Lundberg’s USP is architectural salvage, but, to me, his work is about resurrection. He has restored abandoned factories into famously cool and gimmick-free office spaces, including for Twitter, now X, and Google. He has converted dilapidated, even wrecked homes into minimalist environmentally thoughtful structures. He even repurposed an Icelandic passenger ferry into his own home. Lundberg is inventive about how he repurposes materials, without any resemblance to an earthship! His work is polished modern rectilinear, and , tactile (mostly wood, stone, steel). Not surprising, his brother is the sculptor Peter Lundberg who also works in the language of materials — bronze, concrete.There is a fabrication shop in the office and most recently Lundberge refurbished Google's former R&D facility into a regenerative office space, winning the living building challenge because of its rigorous sustainability standards. Lundberg has always built with the climate in mind: minimizing resource consumption and carbon emissions, using reclaimed materials, and building structures that are in harmony with nature and will outlive us.Lundberg’s studio is on many best of lists: best restaurant architecture  (for Nari), best office architect (for Google and, Twitter, now X), and even best pool ever (HGTV). This month, Lunderg will collect the 2023 Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Virginia School of Architecture. He spoke with me about how he built his personal cabin in a fire zone. A friend of mine runs the design blog, Plain Magazine and he posted the Lundberg/Breuer cabin on their Instagram. I was drawn in by the materials, especially the giant steel windows and the pool with a view. I had to know more. So I found your studio and went down the rabbit hole! First, where is this cabin? It’s in Cazadero, California, and sits on a ridge at 1400-feet elevation overlooking the Sonoma Coast. The cabin has a giant view. And where we are stays quite temperate. It can be 100 degrees Fahrenheit a half mile inland but only 80 degrees at the cabin.

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy of Olle Lundberg.</small></p><p><strong>Tell me about your architectural approach.</strong> </p><p>Generally, my aesthetic is nature-inspired modernism. I really try to build carefully, keeping the notion of craft in my work. I practice legacy architecture. I want it to last for generations and not to be torn down. </p><p><strong>Your <a href="https://habitableliving.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Habitable</a> score shows extremely high fire risk. </strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NeJxFB8SlGDXYFk2tPUlb5Xb_G4rKi5tT9m07pCIKm6mskzyz9hZo32F4QdfoJrTr7ZTw69WL9csBWv7_McrWPmixri2hrz0XGzwJ7Ji7k4ZfRkOR4oaH3_pErUPa6ZgUqfAuTYX_EekAKqDtb7SLgU"/></p><p><strong>Were you aware of that when you rebuilt the house?</strong></p><p>Yes, there is a high fire risk. Yes, I knew this. I bought this property in 1996, and have been building on it ever since. It has been my weekend project. At the time, fire risk was much less apparent than it is now. And we made some decisions that have proven to be good ones.</p><p><strong>Tell me about those decisions.</strong></p><p>The main one is that I installed a copper roof. Copper roofs are completely fireproof, and the roof is the worst thing in terms of a fire. [<em>Gardner: A roof is a large expanse where burning debris can land</em>]. Also copper lasts forever.

And Ipe is guaranteed for 50 years, but probably will last 100.

It was a great old 50,000-gallon watertank that was used for livestock. It was free but cost $30,000 to move. We could hang out in it, but that would be a last ditch thing. In reality, evacuation from our property is not difficult. We would head to the coast. A dangerous fire will usually not come from the coast — it will come from the other side. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

A client was an ex-San Francisco firefighter, and he gave me one of the old SF hydrants. It’s a historic fire hydrant and I powder-coated it red. Also we’re a half mile away from the fire department. They know about the hydrant and could hook up engines to it and fight the fire from my house. Our odds of being protected are pretty good.</p><p><strong>Is there anything you would’ve done differently?</strong> </p><p>One thing I wish I had done differently is the siding. It’s made of wood and I’ll probably redo the siding in the next couple of years. That’s the one flaw in terms of fire danger. While embers are least likely to sit on a vertical surface, if a big fire comes through, I have flammable walls. Still, I do have old industrial steel sash windows which are great in terms of fire — steel is fireproof. The floor inside is slate, which is good in terms of fire danger. </p><p><strong>What are your three top takeaways for people living in a fire zone?</strong></p><p>Most important is a non-combustible roof. Second, limit bushes and low landscaping around the perimeter — no fuel. And third, if possible have a source of water — a pool is best — that the fire department can tap into.</p><p>But above all, make sure you have two exit routes in different directions. Don’t get trapped.</p>

## LOCKSS Program Turns 25

date: 2023-10-04

Happy 25th Birthday LOCKSS! The fifteen-year retrospective is here, and the twenty-year one is here, in which I wrote:

```html
<blockquote>Thanks again to the NSF, Sun Microsystems, and the Andrew W. Mellon 
Foundation for the funding that allowed us to develop the system. Many thanks to
 the steadfast support of the libraries of the LOCKSS Alliance, and the 
libraries and publishers of the CLOCKSS Archive, that has sustained it in
 production. Special thanks to Don Waters for facilitating the program's <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september15/rosenthal/09rosenthal.html">evolution off grant funding</a>, and to <a href="http://mandk.com/">Margaret Kim</a> for the original tortoise logo.<br />

Now for some more gratuitous self-promotion. This means:<br />
<ul>
  <li>I started work on decentralized, permissionless peer-to-peer systems a quarter of a century ago.</li>
  <li>It is two decades since we were awarded an SOSP "Best Paper" for <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/945445.945451"><i>Preserving peer replicas by rate-limited sampled voting</i></a>.</li>

## Search engines, the deal is off!

date: 2023-10-04

```html
<h1>Search engines, the deal is off!</h1>
```

```html
<blockquote>
<p>No one should be required to provide their work for free to any person or organization. The online community is under no responsibility to help them create their products. – <a href="https://neil-clarke.com/block-the-bots-that-feed-ai-models-by-scraping-your-website/" rel="nofollow">Block the Bots that Feed “AI” Models by Scraping Your Website</a></p>
</blockquote>
```

```html
<p>I use something like the following for my webserver to try and deny
all bots, spiders and crawlers access to my site. This is the second
level of defense. Defense in depth is good. Level 1 is robots.txt;
Level 2 is user agent filtering; Level 3 is fail2ban monitoring the
access log and banning anybody who requests stuff faster than I think
people can read.</p>
```

```html
<p>Anyway: user agent filter. These three conditions all need to be true.
The first condition makes sure only the sites listed are affected
(because some sites are exempt…). The second condition makes an
exception for Archive Bot and Gwene. The third condition filters for
all self-identified bots, crawlers and spiders. The actual rule tells
them that the page is gone and should be deleted (status 410), and it
also adds a Location header just in case a human is curious which
leads them to <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/nobots" rel="nofollow">nobots</a>.</p>
```

```html
<p>The reason is this: For a while it seemed that we all benefited from
search engines – authors and readers both. These days, you’ll find
that search results are full of garbage sites. Big sites with the most
flatulent of pages explaining in great detail why the thing you’re
looking for is important and how to do it, clearly optimized for an ad
company and not for a reader. Big sites that have a gazillion answers
are preferred over small and individual sites. Perhaps that’s easier.
Perhaps it allows them to diffuse responsibility for the garbage, I
don’t know. The effect is, in any case, that there is no benefit to
search engines for small site authors, either. I was unable to find my
own pages on the search engines. If you you are a small site owner and
you think you can find your own pages on Google and Bing, I suspect
that’s because they track you. Try it on a different computer,
anonymously. Perhaps you won’t find yourself, either.</p>
```

```html
<p>In any case, if I can’t get anything in return, both as a reader and
as an author, I feel that the deal is off. Why let them feed on my
words for free? Nay, at a cost, since they are keeping my website
busy, producing CO₂ and heating the planet for no benefit at all.</p>

## Thirty Years Ago: MS-DOS 6.00, DoubleSpace, and MultiConfig

date: 2023-10-04

```html
<p>Over 30 years ago, in March 1993, Microsoft released <a href="/software/pcx86/sys/dos/microsoft/6.00/compressed">MS-DOS 6.00</a>,
the next major release of MS-DOS after 5.00 shipped in June 1991.</p>
```

```html
<p>In addition to several new full-screen utilities, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEFRAG</code> to defragment your hard disk (licensed from Symantec),
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MSBACKUP</code> to efficiently backup your hard disk (also licensed from Symantec), and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MSAV</code> to check for viruses (licensed
from Central Point Software), there were a number of new command-line programs, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHOICE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DELTREE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MOVE</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MSCDEX</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SMARTDRV</code>.</p>
```

```html
<p>But the biggest addition to MS-DOS 6.00 was a new feature called <strong>DoubleSpace</strong> (dubbed “MagicDrive” internally) that
automatically compressed everything on your hard disk, providing up to “double” the amount of effective disk space – or more,
or less, depending on how compressible your files were overall.</p>
```

```html
<p>DoubleSpace was a significant feature that required changes across the entire system.  Most of the action, however,
took place inside a new device driver, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DBLSPACE.BIN</code>, that stored all your data in a Compressed Volume File (CVF) generally
named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DBLSPACE.000</code>.  In fact, if you booted an older version of MS-DOS (like 5.00), you wouldn’t see much more than that:</p>
```

```html
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>A&gt;DIR C: /A
```

Volume in drive C is HOST_FOR_C  Volume Serial Number is 5739-B1B5  Directory of C:\

IO       SYS     40470 03-10-93   6:00a MSDOS    SYS     38138 03-10-93   6:00a DBLSPACE BIN     51214 03-10-93   6:00a DBLSPACE INI        91 10-03-23  12:26p DBLSPACE 000 131474432 10-03-23  12:26p         5 file(s)  131604345 bytes                      2605056 bytes free

```html
<p>When MS-DOS 6.00 starts up, it reads <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DBLSPACE.INI</code>, which usually looks something like this:</p>
```

```html
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>MaxRemovableDrives=2
FirstDrive=D
LastDrive=H
MaxFileFragments=115
ActivateDrive=H,C0
</code></pre></div></div>
```

```html
<p>and tells the operating system to mount the <em>real</em> drive C: as drive H: instead, and to mount the CVF as drive C:</p>
```

```html
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C:\&gt;DIR /C
```

Volume in drive C is MS-DOS_6  Volume Serial Number is 101B-323E  Directory of C:\

DOS          &lt;DIR&gt;     09-25-23  10:13p COMMAND  COM     52925 03-10-93   6:00a   1.4 to 1.0 WINA20   386      9349 03-10-93   6:00a   5.3 to 1.0 AUTOEXEC BAT        75 09-26-23   8:55a  16.0 to 1.0 CONFIG   SYS       109 09-26-23   8:55a  16.0 to 1.0                   2.0 to 1.0 average compression ratio         5 file(s)      62458 bytes                    253927424 bytes free

```html
<p>So our original hard disk, a 128Mb drive, now appears to be almost twice as large – thanks to DoubleSpace.</p>
```

```html
<p>Aside from the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DBLSPACE.BIN</code> driver, the other main piece of DoubleSpace functionality resided in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DBLSPACE.EXE</code>, which
operated as both a setup and a maintenance program.  It provided a friendly full-screen interface, making it easy to create
additional CVFs, as well as resize, defragment, reformat, unmount, remount, and more.</p>
```

<h2 id="legal-woes">Legal Woes</h2>
```

```html
<p>Microsoft bootstrapped its compression efforts by licensing code from Vertisoft, makers of DoubleDisk, a disk compression
product first released in 1989.  Starting with Verisoft’s code, Microsoft created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DBLSPACE.BIN</code>, along with operating system
changes that allowed it to be loaded <em>before</em> CONFIG.SYS was processed – so that CONFIG.SYS and any system files loaded
from that point forward could be <em>inside</em> the compressed volume instead of <em>outside</em> it.</p>
```

```html
<p>Vertisoft was not directly involved with any of that work, but they did help produce other pieces of functionality, such
as code to convert Stacker and SuperStor compressed disks to DoubleSpace – although apparently Stacker conversion was pulled
at the last minute, in February 1993, just as MS-DOS 6.00 was being finalized.</p>
```

```html
<p>Or rather, February 1993 would have been “last minute”, until the lawsuit filed by Stac in January 1993 forced Microsoft
to re-evaluate.  Stac claimed that the DoubleSpace infringed two of Stac’s patents: <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5016009A/en">5,016,009</a> and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4701745A/en?oq=US4701745">4,701,745</a>.</p>
```

```html
<p>For me, life quickly changed on February 13, 1993, when I received this email:</p>

You are both amongst the best x86 assembly language coders that we have at MS. We are thus asking you to help out with a very serious problem that we face - namely the STAC / DOS6 lawsuit.

Our lawyers have recommended that we have a backup compression mechanism for DOS6 ready to go as soon as possible. The initial work on this has been done under Rick Rashid in Nathanm's area. They have a C language implementation of a technique that we believe is safe (covered under patents that we have rights to). The challenge is to get this technique into the tightest possible x86 assembly code, as soon as possible. This is where we are asking you to help. Jimall and Bradsi are aware that you will be "stolen" for some weeks.

Could you both meet with Rick Rashid as early as possible on Monday to get this effort under way as soon as is possible. Thanks.

```html
<p>The next several weeks were probably some of the most stressful that I’d experienced at Microsoft.  Looking back, it’s amazing
to me that with all the critical-path code that was being rewritten at that late date, MS-DOS 6.00 still shipped the following
month, in March 1993.</p>
```

```html
<p>I don’t recall all the details of the alleged patent infringement, and I’m not sure I ever knew all the details, because frankly,
it wasn’t necessary for me to know the details.  A number of other people had already been working on the problem and had come up
with several solutions, and it simply fell to me and MarkZ to implement them in x86 assembly – preferably very fast, bug-free
assembly, of course.</p>
```

```html
<p>As far as I can tell now, Stac patent 5,016,009 was the crux of the problem.  It combined LZ77 compression with hashing, and
while LZ77 compression was fine, and hashing was fine, apparently the <em>combination</em> of the two became a patentable innovation.</p>
```

```html
<p>So we were initially tasked with writing a compressor based on <strong>Miller-Wegman</strong>, an algorithm that was either not patented or
that Microsoft owned or licensed.  When that turned out to be too slow, we instead built a compressor (internally known as XCFR or
the “Rashid Search Algorithm”) that avoided hashing by using a 256x8 look-up table along with a 256-entry LRU table, and also
incorporated a new Microsoft Realtime Compression Format (MRCF) for outputting the raw bytes and offset-length pairs.  That,
of course, meant that the decompressor had to be rewritten as well.</p>
```

```html
<p>With hindsight, it’s probably safe to say that Microsoft should <em>not</em> have shipped MS-DOS 6.00 quite so quickly after that
rewrite, because unfortunately, our code (well, in the case below, <em>my</em> code) was not, um, bug-free:</p>

In RDCOMP.ASM, near the first JC instruction, there is a bug when a block ends at 10000h and the last several bytes are in a repeat string.  It was reported by Temporal Acuity Products.

well... shit!

```html
<p>That bug was only in the 80386 code path, so it could be avoided by adding an undocumented “ENABLE386=0” to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DBLSPACE.INI</code>, but that wasn’t much consolation.  And it was one of at least a half-dozen or so DoubleSpace bugs that Microsoft was aware by June of 1993.  Other bugs included:</p>
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>A particular series of reads, writes, and undeletes may cause an undelete to fail (FAT is marked USED, but MDFAT is left marked FREE; note that MDFAT refers to the “MagicDrive” FAT internal to the CVF)</li>
  <li>A particular series of operations followed by undelete may cause a cross link (not taking into account data that may be in buffers)</li>
  <li>Read into video memory in planar VGA modes results in garbage display (decompression depends on being able to read previously decompressed data, but VGA memory in these video modes does not read back what was written to it)</li>
  <li>If a disk error occurs while updating a cluster, a cross link may be created (error would be on writing to a part of the sector heap that we had not used previously)</li>
  <li>When Metro Software’s LaserTwin 5.0 TSR is loaded, it intercepts write operations and breaks them up into smaller writes; however, sometimes those smaller writes can end up being ZERO bytes long, which DOS correctly treats as a truncate operation.  If that happens when the system is writing to the DoubleSpace CVF, the compressed volume will be truncated (not really a DoubleSpace bug, but a bug with severe consequences)</li>
</ul>
```

```html
<p>I don’t know if the video memory issue was ever fixed.  Wikipedia’s article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DriveSpace">DriveSpace</a> (which was the new name for DoubleSpace as of MS-DOS 6.22) alludes to the problem:</p>
```

```html
<blockquote>
  <p>A few computer programs, particularly games, were incompatible with DoubleSpace because they effectively bypassed the DoubleSpace driver.</p>
</blockquote>
```

```html
<p>But I’m not aware of any problems that involved “bypassing” the driver.  Any game-related problems were almost certainly due to DoubleSpace decompressing data directly into video memory when the video card’s read and write modes differed.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-multiconfig">Introducing MultiConfig</h2>
```

```html
<p>On a happier, or at least less contentious note, MS-DOS 6.00 also introduced a feature known as <strong>MultiConfig</strong>, which I
have some fondness for, because it was something I personally championed and implemented.  And – good news – I don’t think
it had any serious bugs.</p>
```

```html
<p>I don’t recall precisely where the idea came from.  I think it started as something that I and Naveen Jain, a Program Manager
on the team, discussed in early 1992.  He created a preliminary spec in February 1992, and then I implemented the feature
in March 1992 and updated the spec to match what I had implemented.</p>
```

```html
<p>The code was originally added to <strong>Jaguar</strong>, which was planned to be the next major update to MS-DOS after 5.00.
But at some point, <strong>Astro</strong> – originally intended as a smaller interim MS-DOS update – grew to the point where it was
clearly going to be the next major update, thanks in large part to the addition of DoubleSpace disk compression.</p>
```

```html
<p>When it was clear that <strong>Astro</strong> would become MS-DOS 6.00, I think management went looking for other low-hanging fruit,
such as any new <strong>Jaguar</strong> features that could be incorporated into <strong>Astro</strong> relatively easily with minimal risk.
MultiConfig fit the bill.</p>
```

```html
<p>However, it wasn’t a slam dunk.  I had to push for it, because there were a few risk-averse people in management that felt
the risk/reward ratio was too high.  They claimed that most users would not use this feature (which was true), but that point
also worked in my favor: most of the new code would not be executed until and unless someone actually added one or more of the
new commands to their CONFIG.SYS.  So any risks largely affected only “power users”.</p>
```

```html
<h2 id="what-is-multiconfig">What is MultiConfig?</h2>
```

```html
<p>MultiConfig was a collection of features added to the processing of CONFIG.SYS, to make it easier to start your PC
in a particular way without having to boot from a special floppy or edit/copy a new CONFIG.SYS each time.  It added some new
commands to CONFIG.SYS:</p>
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>INCLUDE</li>
  <li>MENUCOLOR</li>
  <li>MENUDEFAULT</li>
  <li>MENUITEM</li>
  <li>NUMLOCK</li>
  <li>SET</li>
  <li>SUBMENU</li>
</ul>
```

```html
<p>and it included some new ways to interact with CONFIG.SYS.  The message “Starting MS-DOS…” was added as an indirect means
of alerting you that you now had two seconds to press one of several new start-up keys:</p>
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>F5: Bypass CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT</li>
  <li>F8: Interactively step through CONFIG.SYS</li>
</ul>
```

```html
<p>You could also tap a Shift key – that was equivalent to pressing F5.  Apparently there was an Astro “press tour” in August
1992, and someone in that tour suggested adding the Shift key, so we did.  They claimed that holding the Shift key while
starting Windows also bypassed certain files and/or functions, but I don’t recall to what extent that was true.</p>
```

```html
<p>Additionally, if you didn’t want anyone using your machine to bypass or alter CONFIG.SYS, you could add
these lines to the file:</p>
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>SWITCHES=/N: disable all start-up keys</li>
  <li>SWITCHES=/F: eliminate the two-second pause</li>
</ul>
```

```html
<p>/N also implied /F, since if start-up keys were disabled, there was no need to wait two seconds.</p>
```

```html
<p>Note that SWITCHES was not a new command; other older “switches” included:</p>
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>/K: Forces an enhanced keyboard to behave like a conventional keyboard (DOS 4.0+)</li>
  <li>/T: Indicates the BIOS time rollover byte is a flag instead of a counter (DOS 5.0+)</li>
  <li>/W: Specifies that the WINA20.386 file has been moved to a directory other than the root directory (DOS 5.0+)</li>
</ul>
```

```html
<p>Finally, while we’re on the subject of the keyboard-related features, I should add that NUMLOCK wasn’t really a MultiConfig
feature; it was just something I thought would be handy.  Recall that early PCs had no BIOS setup screens, and MS-DOS was
still an operating system designed to run on any PC, including the original IBM PC.  So this CONFIG.SYS command:</p>
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>NUMLOCK=[ON|OFF]</li>
</ul>
```

```html
<p>could be used to set your keyboard’s initial Num-Lock state.  A case could be made for this being a legitimate
MultiConfig feature though, since you could select menu items with arrow keys <em>or</em> by pressing the number of a menu item.
So if you wanted to use your numeric keypad, then you would want to ensure that Num-Lock matched your preferred selection
method.</p>
```

```html
<h2 id="with-great-power-comes-menus">With Great Power Comes… Menus</h2>
```

```html
<p>The real power of MultiConfig was the ability to create user-friendly boot menus and let you organize sets of CONFIG.SYS
commands into either named or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[common]</code> blocks.  Blocks began with a bracketed block name (eg, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[menu]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[common]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[doslow]</code>)
and ended at the next bracketed block name (or end of file).</p>
```

```html
<p>Here’s a simple example:</p>
```

```html
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[menu]
menuitem=doslow,Load DOS in LOW memory
menuitem=doshigh,Load DOS in HIGH memory
menudefault=doslow,15
menucolor=15,1
```

[common] device=c:\dos\himem.sys

[doslow] dos=low

[doshigh] dos=high

[common] device=c:\dos\setver.exe files=30

```html
<p>And the screen that would appear when booting:</p>
```

```html
<p><img src="/blog/images/msdos600-multiconfig.png" alt="MS-DOS 6.00 MultiConfig" /></p>
```

```html
<p>Each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">menuitem</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[menu]</code> block describes a menu item; the first argument is a block name (eg, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doslow</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doshigh</code>),
and the second argument is a description.  Other <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[menu]</code> block keywords included <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">menudefault</code>, which specifies the
default menu item (and optional timeout value in seconds), and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">menucolor</code>, which selects foreground and background colors
for the menu.</p>
```

```html
<p>In the above example, no matter which menu item you selected, HIMEM.SYS would always be loaded first, because it was in a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[common]</code> block that appeared before the other blocks.  Then all commands in the selected block (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[doslow]</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[doshigh]</code>) would be processed next, then all the commands in the next <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[common]</code> block – and so on.</p>
```

```html
<p>Another feature was “forced prompting”.  If you included a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEVICE</code> keyword, you would receive an unconditional
prompt for that particular driver.  For example:</p>
```

```html
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>device?=c:\dos\setver.exe
</code></pre></div></div>
```

```html
<p>would <em>always</em> generate the following prompt:</p>
```

```html
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE [Y,N]?
</code></pre></div></div>
```

```html
<p>And that feature wasn’t limited to device drivers.  The following line:</p>
```

```html
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>dos?=high
</code></pre></div></div>
```

```html
<p>would also generate a prompt:</p>
```

```html
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>DOS=HIGH [Y,N]?
</code></pre></div></div>
```

```html
<h2 id="menu-overload">Menu Overload</h2>
```

```html
<p>Below is a more complex example, extracted from an email I wrote back on July 1, 1992 (at 2:34am apparently).</p>
```

```html
<p>This example illustrates how you could use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">submenu</code> (as opposed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">menuitem</code>) to define menu items that
referred to other menu blocks, in order to create multi-level menus.  Originally, the keyword for that feature was
simply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">menu</code>, but the <strong>Astro</strong> team (specifically, Betsy Tinney, who helped refine the MultiConfig UI for <strong>Astro</strong>)
suggested a keyword that was clearer.</p>
```

```html
<p>It also shows how you could <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include</code> named blocks from other blocks.  For example, a number of the blocks, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[dosumb]</code>,
include another block, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[dos]</code>, that contains commands common to the other blocks.  Every block <em>could</em> duplicate those
commands itself, but factoring out common sets of commands made for a more maintainable CONFIG.SYS.  Blocks named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[common]</code>
were <em>always</em> processed in the order they appeared, whereas blocks with any other name would be processed whenever
(and <em>only</em> whenever) they were explicitly included.</p>
```

```html
<p>Finally, this example also uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SET</code> command, which defines environment variables to be passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COMMAND.COM</code>.
In addition, a special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONFIG</code> environment variable is automatically set to the name of the block from the final selected
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">menuitem</code> (eg, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dosumb</code>).  This was useful for batch files like AUTOEXEC.BAT, if they needed to customize their actions
according to the selected CONFIG.SYS configuration.</p>
```

```html
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[menu]

@"~Dave Winer's Scripting News" (date: 2023-10-03)

Just read the Wikipedia page on weblogs.com. I didn't "decide" to shut down the site in 2004. The management of UserLand at the time transfered the domain to one of my two servers at a local Boston-area hosting service, without telling me they were doing it. It knocked the server off the air. That was what caused the outage. It took a few days to get it back online. The secret -- we converted the site to PHP and it ran much better. No one decided anything.

## Electric Cars Are Better. Period.

date: 2023-10-03

Fear of the unknown is only natural. It’s no surprise many drivers who are unfamiliar with electric vehicles worry that if they make the leap to this new technology, their lives will be plagued by problems they’ve heard about on the news like range anxiety or long recharge times. Predictably, those with a political ax to grind against electrification stoke those fears, hoping to paint EV as a deficient or inferior product, or a sacrifice big government wants you to make for the greater good. They are wrong.

```html
<p>I won’t lie to you and say EVs are flawless. There are things gasoline gas does that electric cannot, such as making a Cannonball Run across the country with a bare minimum of stops. What you might not realize if you’ve yet to drive or own an EV, however, is all of the ways that they are clearly, obviously <em>better</em>. Yes, the climate case for electric vehicles powered by renewable energy is the big, bold-faced reason to move away from internal combustion. Even if you set aside green reasons to buy an EV, the electric life is an upgrade.</p><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p><em>Get one great climate story in your inbox every day:</em></p><p></p><div class="horizontal-rule"></div>
<p class="drop-caps">Fearmongering about EVs often focuses on long-distance driving, since this is the one place where gasoline holds a clear advantage — yes, it is slightly more cumbersome to rely on EV fast-chargers than it is to pull off the interstate for five minutes or less whenever you need gas. As charging gets faster, though, and battery ranges get longer, the inconvenience gap is shrinking. At a certain point, the distance you can travel down the highway on one charge will be greater than or equal to the amount of time you’d want to go between bathroom breaks, anyway.</p>
<p>Now ask yourself: What are your driving habits actually like? If you’re like most Americans, you take the occasional long road trip, but 90 percent of your driving happens within a few dozen miles of home: getting groceries, commuting, dropping off the kids at dance practice. (There’s a reason most auto accidents <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a2108966/survey-finds-vehicle-crashes-most-likely-occur-close-home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">happen</a> within 15 miles of home. It’s where we drive.) </p>
<p>You don’t need gasoline to live like this. EV owners can plug into the garage after work and wake up each morning with more than enough range for the daily grind. No more stopping at the gas station on the way home from work and standing out in the blazing heat or freezing cold to pump fossil fuels into your car. </p>
<p>Saying goodbye to the gas station also, mercifully, means saying goodbye to paying for gas. As I write this in Los Angeles, the <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/page/2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">average price</a> in California has exceeded $6 per gallon, while the national average is up to $3.79. For a variety of reasons, it’s difficult to do an apples-to-apples cost comparison between gas and electric. They don’t commonly use the same units; electricity can have a much different price per kilowatt-hour depending on the time of day and whether you charge at home or at a public fast-charger. However, although you can find studies that bend over backward to <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a38043667/study-electric-cars-higher-cost-questions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">twist the numbers</a> to favor gasoline, driving electric typically <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/shopping-advice/a32494027/ev-vs-gas-cheaper-to-own/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">costs</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/19/cost-of-charging-ev-vs-gas-prices.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">less</a> per mile. The gap gets bigger if you live in a state with high gas prices or do nearly all your charging at home, where it’s cheap.</p>
<p>Those savings, along with government incentives, made the higher up-front cost of an EV easier to swallow. So does the potential for <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-maintenance-tesla-tires" target="_self">less routine maintenance</a>. I can’t tell you how nice it is to forget about oil changes.</p><p>Then there’s performance. </p><p>Today’s super-deluxe EVs post bonkers zero-to-sixty times. High-end versions of the Tesla Model S, Lucid Air, Porsche Taycan, and even the Rivian R1T pickup truck hit the mark in <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g40971175/fastest-electric-cars/" target="_blank">three seconds or less</a>. The <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a38887851/why-are-evs-so-quick/" target="_blank">reason</a> is mechanical: An electric motor can deliver all its torque from a stop, while a gas engine is particular about just where it can reach peak horsepower and torque. </p><p>This truth matters even if you’re not planning to spend six figures on an electric car, because it means even the more modestly priced EVs are just fun to drive, with lots of zip off the starting line. Forget the car guy stats: What will make you happy is the feeling as your EV silently pins you back against the seat or effortlessly accelerates to highway speed as you merge — the moment of Zen that has been promised by a thousand <a href="https://www.factorydetroit.com/2015/04/21/car-advertising-cliches/" target="_blank">cliched car commercials</a>. And you don’t have to spend a hundred thousand dollars to get it.</p>
<p>EV ownership also delivers other little <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-battery-ac-dc-bidirectional" target="_self">quality-of-life improvements</a>. For example, full climate control: A big battery means you can blast the car’s AC or heat for a long time without running a gasoline engine. It means you’re not polluting the neighborhood’s air as you sit there idling for minutes on end, waiting for the kid you’re picking up to get in the car already. It means you can preheat or pre-cool the car from inside the house, or leave the vehicle on Dog Mode so it air-conditions your pooch while you run into Starbucks.</p>
<p>A combustion vehicle will always be a rolling, carbon-emitting power plant. An EV has the potential to be much more — part of a smarter, more integrated future. Homeowners with solar panels could use that clean energy to fill up their car batteries. And when more vehicles join the Ford F-150 Lightning in offering two-way charging, more EV owners will be able to use their cars as a power supply that could, for example, keep the house lights on in case of a blackout. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="drop-caps">Electric isn’t for everyone. Not at this moment, anyhow. For people who can’t charge at home or <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/every-office-should-have-an-electric-car-charger" target="_self">at work</a>, the challenge of getting electricity at public fast-chargers can be too annoying or expensive. If you drive lots of miles off the beaten path, far from the interstate highway system, you might wait, justifiably, until the map fills in with more chargers.</p>
<p>For the urbanite or suburbanite, it’s time to get real. We all want our cars to do everything, and yes, for the occasional journey of four-plus hours, it’d be slightly easier to keep burning gas. Life isn’t summer vacation, though. Life is driving to work and to date night. Life is sitting in traffic and then feeling that sweet exhale of accelerating when it finally opens up. Electric isn’t just better for the planet — for everyday driving, electric is better for you, too. </p><p><em>Read more about EVs:</em></p><p><em><a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/why-the-cheapest-ev-in-the-world-is-actually-better-than-all-the-better-evs" target="_blank">I Can’t Stop Driving This Ludicrously Cheap Chinese EV</a></em></p>

## Pluralistic: Google's enshittification memos (03 Oct 2023)

date: 2023-10-03

Today's links Google's enshittification memos: Truly, Big Tech can't stop telling on itself. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Google's enshittification memos (permalink) [Note, 9 October 2023: Google disputes the veracity of this claim, but has declined to provide the exhibits and testimony to support its claims. Read more about this here.] When I think about how the old, good internet turned into the enshitternet, I imagine a series of small compromises, each seemingly reasonable at the time, each contributing to a cultural norm of making good things worse, and worse, and worse. Think about Unity President Marc Whitten's nonpology for his company's disastrous rug-pull, in which they declared that everyone who had paid good money to use their tool to make a game would have to keep paying, every time someone downloaded that game: The most fundamental thing that we’re trying to do is we’re building a sustainable business for Unity. And for us, that means that we do need to have a model that includes some sort of balancing change, including shared success. https://www.wired.com/story/unity-walks-back-policies-lost-trust/[337] "Shared success" is code for, "If you use our tool to make money, we should make money too." This is bullshit. It's like saying, "We just want to find a way to share the success of the painters who use our brushes, so every time you sell a painting, we want to tax that sale." Or "Every time you sell a house, the company that made the hammer gets to wet its beak." And note that they're not talking about shared risk here &#8211; no one at Unity is saying, "If you try to make a game with our tools and you lose a million bucks, we're on the hook for ten percent of your losses." This isn't partnership, it's extortion. How did a company like Unity &#8211; which became a market leader by making a tool that understood the needs of game developers and filled them &#8211; turn into a protection racket? One bad decision at a time. One rationalization and then another. Slowly, and then all at once. When I think about this enshittification curve, I often think of Google, a company that had its users' backs for years, which created a genuinely innovative search engine that worked so well it seemed like *magic, a company whose employees often had their pick of jobs, but chose the "don't be evil" gig because that mattered to them. People make fun of that "don't be evil" motto, but if your key employees took the gig because they didn't want to be evil, and then you ask them to be evil, they might just quit. Hell, they might make a stink on the way out the door, too: https://theintercept.com/2018/09/13/google-china-search-engine-employee-resigns/[338] Google is a company whose founders started out by publishing a scientific paper describing their search methodology, in which they said, "Oh, and by the way, ads will inevitably turn your search engine into a pile of shit, so we're gonna stay the fuck away from them": http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf[339] Those same founders retained a controlling interest in the company after it went IPO, explaining to investors that they were going to run the business without having their elbows jostled by shortsighted Wall Street assholes, so they could keep it from turning into a pile of shit: https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/ipo-letter/[340] And yet, it's turned into a pile of shit. Google search is so bad you might as well ask Jeeves. The company's big plan to fix it? Replace links to webpages with florid paragraphs of chatbot nonsense filled with a supremely confident lies: https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/14/googles-ai-hype-circle/[341] How did the company get this bad? In part, this is the "curse of bigness." The company can't grow by attracting new users. When you have 90%+ of the market, there are no new customers to sign up. Hypothetically, they could grow by going into new lines of business, but Google is incapable of making a successful product in-house and also kills most of the products it buys from other, more innovative companies: https://killedbygoogle.com/[342] Theoretically, the company could pursue new lines of business in-house, and indeed, the current leaders of companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple are all execs who figured out how to get the whole company to do something new, and were elevated to the CEO's office, making each one a billionaire and sealing their place in history. It is for this very reason that any exec at a large firm who tries to make a business-wide improvement gets immediately and repeatedly knifed by all their colleagues, who correctly reason that if someone else becomes CEO, then they won't become CEO. Machiavelli was an optimist: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/microincentives-and-enshittification/[343] With no growth from new customers, and no growth from new businesses, "growth" has to come from squeezing workers (say, laying off 12,000 engineers after a stock buyback that would have paid their salaries for the next 27 years), or business customers (say, by colluding with Facebook to rig the ad market with the Jedi Blue conspiracy), or end-users. Now, in theory, we might never know exactly what led to the enshittification of Google. In theory, all of compromises, debates and plots could be lost to history. But tech is not an oral culture, it's a written one, and techies write everything down and nothing is ever truly deleted. Time and again, Big Tech tells on itself. Think of FTX's main conspirators all hanging out in a group chat called "Wirefraud." Amazon naming its program targeting weak, small publishers the "Gazelle Project" ("approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle”). Amazon documenting the fact that users were unknowingly signing up for Prime and getting pissed; then figuring out how to reduce accidental signups, then deciding not to do it because it liked the money too much. Think of Zuck emailing his CFO in the middle of the night to defend his outsized offer to buy Instagram on the basis that users like Insta better and Facebook couldn't compete with them on quality. It's like every Big Tech schemer has a folder on their desktop called "Mens Rea" filled with files like "Copy_of_Premeditated_Murder.docx": https://doctorow.medium.com/big-tech-cant-stop-telling-on-itself-f7f0eb6d215a?sk=351f8a54ab8e02d7340620e5eec5024d[344] Right now, Google's on trial for its sins against antitrust law. It's a hard case to make. To secure a win, the prosecutors at the DoJ Antitrust Division are going to have to prove what was going on in Google execs' minds when they took the actions that led to the company's dominance. They're going to have to show that the company deliberately undertook to harm its users and customers. Of course, it helps that Google put it all in writing. Last week, there was a huge kerfuffile over the DoJ's practice of posting its exhibits from the trial to a website each night. This is a totally normal thing to do &#8211; a practice that dates back to the Microsoft antitrust trial. But Google pitched a tantrum over this and said that the docs the DoJ were posting would be turned into "clickbait." Which is another way of saying, "the public would find these documents very interesting, and they would be damning to us and our case": https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/secrecy-is-systemic[345] After initially deferring to Google, Judge Amit Mehta finally gave the Justice Department the greenlight to post the document. It's up. It's wild: https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-09/416692.pdf[346] The document is described as "notes for a course on communication" that Google VP for Finance Michael Roszak prepared. Roszak says he can't remember whether he ever gave the presentation, but insists that the remit for the course required him to tell students "things I didn't believe," and that's why the document is "full of hyperbole and exaggeration." OK. But here's what the document says: "search advertising is one of the world's greatest business models ever created&#8230;illicit businesses (cigarettes or drugs) could rival these economics&#8230;[W]e can mostly ignore the demand side&#8230;(users and queries) and only focus on the supply side of advertisers, ad formats and sales." It goes on to say that this might be changing, and proposes a way to balance the interests of the search and ads teams, which are at odds, with search worrying that ads are pushing them to produce "unnatural search experiences to chase revenue." "Unnatural search experiences to chase revenue" is a thinly veiled euphemism for the prophetic warnings in that 1998 Pagerank paper: "The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users." Or, more plainly, "ads will turn our search engine into a pile of shit." And, as Roszak writes, Google is "able to ignore one of the fundamental laws of economics&#8230;supply and demand." That is, the company has become so dominant and cemented its position so thoroughly as the default search engine across every platforms and system that even if it makes its search terrible to goose revenues, users won't leave. As Lily Tomlin put it on SNL: "We don't have to care, we're the phone company." In the enshittification cycle, companies first lure in users with surpluses &#8211; like providing the best search results rather than the most profitable ones &#8211; with an eye to locking them in. In Google's case, that lock-in has multiple facets, but the big one is spending billions of dollars &#8211; enough to buy a whole Twitter, every single year &#8211; to be the default search everywhere. Google doesn't buy its way to dominance because it has the very best search results and it wants to shield you from inferior competitors. The economically rational case for buying default position is that preventing competition is more profitable than succeeding by outperforming competitors. The best reason to buy the default everywhere is that it lets you lower quality without losing business. You can "ignore the demand side, and only focus on advertisers." For a lot of people, the analysis stops here. "If you're not paying for the product, you're the product." Google locks in users and sells them to advertisers, who are their co-conspirators in a scheme to screw the rest of us. But that's not right. For one thing, paying for a product doesn't mean you won't be the product. Apple charges a thousand bucks for an iPhone and then nonconsensually spies on every iOS user in order to target ads to them (and lies about it): https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar[347] John Deere charges six figures for its tractors, then runs a grift that blocks farmers from fixing their own machines, and then uses their control over repair to silence farmers who complain about it: https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/31/dealers-choice/#be-a-shame-if-something-were-to-happen-to-it[348] Fair treatment from a corporation isn't a loyalty program that you earn by through sufficient spending. Companies that can sell you out, will sell you out, and then cry victim, insisting that they were only doing their fiduciary duty for their sacred shareholders. Companies are disciplined by fear of competition, regulation or &#8211; in the case of tech platforms &#8211; customers seizing the means of computation and installing ad-blockers, alternative clients, multiprotocol readers, etc: https://doctorow.medium.com/an-audacious-plan-to-halt-the-internets-enshittification-and-throw-it-into-reverse-3cc01e7e4604?sk=85b3f5f7d051804521c3411711f0b554[349] Which is where the next stage of enshittification comes in: when the platform withdraws the surplus it had allocated to lure in &#8211; and then lock in &#8211; business customers (like advertisers) and reallocate it to the platform's shareholders. For Google, there are several rackets that let it screw over advertisers as well as searchers (the advertisers are paying for the product, and they're also the product). Some of those rackets are well-known, like Jedi Blue, the market-rigging conspiracy that Google and Facebook colluded on: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Blue[350] But thanks to the antitrust trial, we're learning about more of these. Megan Gray &#8211; ex-FTC, ex-DuckDuckGo &#8211; was in the courtroom last week when evidence was presented on Google execs' panic over a decline in "ad generating searches" and the sleazy gimmick they came up with to address it: manipulating the "semantic matching" on user queries: https://www.wired.com/story/google-antitrust-lawsuit-search-results/[351] When you send a query to Google, it expands that query with terms that are similar &#8211; for example, if you search on "Weds" it might also search for "Wednesday." In the slides shown in the Google trial, we learned about another kind of semantic matching that Google performed, this one intended to turn your search results into "a twisted shopping mall you can’t escape." Here's how that worked: when you ran a query like "children's clothing," Google secretly appended the brand name of a kids' clothing manufacturer to the query. This, in turn, triggered a ton of ads &#8211; because rival brands will have bought ads against their competitors' name (like Pepsi buying ads that are shown over queries for Coke). Here we see surpluses being taken away from both end-users and business customers &#8211; that is, searchers and advertisers. For searchers, it doesn't matter how much you refine your query, you're still going to get crummy search results because there's an unkillable, hidden search term stuck to your query, like a piece of shit that Google keeps sticking to the sole of your shoe. But for advertisers, this is also a scam. They're paying to be matched to users who search on a brand name, and you didn't search on that brand name. It's especially bad for the company whose name has been appended to your search, because Google has a protection racket where the company that matches your search has to pay extra in order to show up overtop of rivals who are worse matches. Both the matching company and those rivals have given Google a credit-card that Google gets to bill every time a user searches on the company's name, and Google is just running fraudulent charges through those cards. And, of course, Google put this in writing. I mean, of course they did. As we learned from the documentary The Incredibles, supervillains can't stop themselves from monologuing, and in big, sprawling monopolists, these monologues have to transmitted electronically &#8211; and often indelibly &#8211; to far-flung co-cabalists. As Gray points out, this is an incredibly blunt enshittification technique: "it hadn’t even occurred to me that Google just flat out deletes queries and replaces them with ones that monetize better." We don't know how long Google did this for or how frequently this bait-and-switch was deployed. But if this is a blunt way of Google smashing its fist down on the scales that balance search quality against ad revenues, there's plenty of subtler ways the company could sneak a thumb on there. A Google exec at the trial rhapsodized about his company's "contract with the user" to deliver an "honest results policy," but given how bad Google search is these days, we're left to either believe he's lying or that Google sucks at search. The paper trail offers a tantalizing look at how a company went from doing something that was so good it felt like a magic trick to being "able to ignore one of the fundamental laws of economics&#8230;supply and demand," able to "ignore the demand side&#8230;(users and queries) and only focus on the supply side of advertisers." What's more, this is a system where everyone loses (except for Google): this isn't a grift run by Google and advertisers on users &#8211; it's a grift Google runs on everyone.

## Hacking Gas Pumps via Bluetooth

date: 2023-10-02

```html
<p>Turns out pumps at gas stations are controlled via Bluetooth, and that the connections are <a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/detroit-man-steals-800-gallons-using-bluetooth-to-hack-gas-pumps-at-station">insecure</a>. No details in the article, but it seems that it&#8217;s easy to take control of the pump and have it dispense gas without requiring payment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a complicated crime to monetize, though. You need to sell access to the gas pump to others.</p>

## Rivian Is Having a Normal One

date: 2023-10-02

After a slow start, production at the electric truck maker Rivian is revving up. The company announced today that it made 16,304 new vehicles in the third quarter of 2023 and delivered about 15,500 of them.That’s about 2,000 vehicles better than Wall Street analysts were expecting, according to CNBC, and it puts Rivian on target to beat its goal of shipping 52,000 vehicles this year. Rivian’s consumer vehicles — the R1T, a pickup, and R1, a three-row SUV — go for about $80,000 a pop. The company also makes delivery vehicles for Amazon. This quarter, Rivian made all its vehicles in its factory in Normal, Illinois, although it’s received the go-ahead to build a second facility in Georgia.We won’t learn more about the company’s financials until next month, when it unveils its full quarterly earnings. But just because Rivian is shipping expensive trucks doesn’t mean that it’s making money off them. From April to June, the company lost $30,000 for every vehicle that it sold, The Wall Street Journal reported today, and R.J. Scaringe, its CEO, is now “rushing to slash expenses and slim down operations.” The company made nearly 14,000 vehicles in the second quarter and lost $1.19 billion.Earlier this year, Scaringe told me that Rivian was still trying to rebound from rolling out its production vehicles amid the pandemic. “I don’t think you could have designed a more complex environment to do that in,” he said. “The supply chain catastrophe that was 2022 was our launching ramp here. And then managing the build-out of a large, 5,000-plus person workforce to produce vehicles in our first plant, in the middle of a pandemic, was also really hard.” Rivian’s stock fell 2.55% in trading today, while the S&P 500 was essentially flat.

## The Bleeding Edge of Swift Concurrency

date: 2023-10-02

Matthew Massicotte (Mastodon, via Juri Pakaste): Swift Concurrency is all about succinct, safe code. Yet, it comes with a surprising amount of subtly and new pitfalls. It&#8217;s actually quite easy to accidentally introduce races and hangs. Learn about bringing async/await and actors into your code without the pain. There&#8217;s a lot packed into this short [&#8230;]

Helge He&#223;: ManagedModels is a package that provides a Swift 5.9 macro similar to the SwiftData @Model. It can generate CoreData ManagedObjectModel&#8217;s declaratively from Swift classes, w/o having to use the Xcode &#8220;CoreData Modeler&#8221;.Unlike SwiftData it doesn&#8217;t require iOS 17+ and works directly w/ CoreData. It is not a direct API replacement, but a look-a-like.[&#8230;]A [&#8230;]

## Pluralistic: Kickstarting the audiobook of The Lost Cause, my novel of environmental hope (02 Oct 2023)

date: 2023-10-02

Today's links Kickstarting the audiobook of The Lost Cause, my novel of environmental hope: And another one that Amazon won't sell. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Kickstarting the audiobook of The Lost Cause, my novel of environmental hope (permalink) The Lost Cause is my next novel. It's about the climate emergency. It's hopeful. Library Journal called it "a message hope in a near-future that looks increasingly bleak." As with every other one of my books Amazon refuses to sell the audiobook, so I made my own, and I'm pre-selling it on Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/the-lost-cause-a-novel-of-climate-and-hope[396] That's a lot to unpack, I know. So many questions! Including this one: "How is it that I have another book out in 2023?" Because this is my third book this year. Short answer: I write when I'm anxious, so I came out of lockdown with nine books. Nine! Hope and writing are closely related activities. Hope (the belief that you can make things better) is nothing so cheap and fatalistic as optimism (the belief that things will improve no matter what you do). The Lost Cause is full of people who are full of hope. The action begins a full generation after the Hail Mary passage of the Green New Deal, and the people who grew up fighting the climate emergency (rather than sitting hopelessly by while the powers that be insisted that nothing could or should be done) have a name for themselves: they call themselves "the first generation in a century that doesn't fear the future." I fear the future. Unchecked corporate power has us barreling over a cliff's edge and all the one-percent has to say is, "Well, it's too late to swerve now, what if the bus rolls and someone breaks a leg? Don't worry, we'll just keep speeding up and leap the gorge": https://locusmag.com/2022/07/cory-doctorow-the-swerve/[397] That unchecked corporate power has no better avatar than Amazon, one of the tech monopolies that has converted the old, good internet into "five giant websites, each filled with screenshots of the other four": https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1069674780826071040[398] Amazon maintains a near-total grip over print and ebooks, but when it comes to audiobooks, that control is total. The company's Audible division has captured more than 90% of the market, and it abuses that dominance to cram Digital Rights Management onto every book it sells, even if the author doesn't want it: https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/25/can-you-hear-me-now/#acx-ripoff[399] I wrote a whole-ass book about this and it came out less than a month ago; it's called The Internet Con and it lays out an audacious plan to halt the internet's enshittification and throw it into reverse: http://www.seizethemeansofcomputation.org/[400] The tldr is this: when an audiobook is wrapped in Amazon's DRM, only Amazon can legally remove it. That means that every book I sell you on Audible is a book you have to throw away if you ever break up with Amazon, and Amazon can use the fact that it's hold you hostage to screw me &#8211; and every other author &#8211; over. As I said last time this came up: Fuck that sideways. With a brick. My books are sold without DRM, so you can play them in any app and do anything copyright permits, and that means Amazon won't carry them, and that means my publishers don't want to pay to produce them, and that means I produce them myself, and then I make the (significant) costs back by selling them on Kickstarter. And you know what? It works. Readers don't want DRM. I mean, duh. No one woke up this morning and said, "Dammit, why won't someone sell me a product that lets me do less with my books?" I sell boatloads" of books through these crowdfunding campaigns. I sold so many copies of my last book, *The Internet Con, that they sold out the initial print run in two weeks (don't worry, they held back stock for my upcoming events). But beyond that, I think there's another reason my readers keep coming back, even though I wrote a genuinely stupid number of books while working through lockdown anxiety while the wildfires raged and ashes sifted down out of the sky and settled on my laptop as I lay in my backyard hammock, pounding my keyboard. (I went through two keyboards during lockdown. Thankfully, I bought a user-serviceable laptop from Framework and fixed it myself both times, in a matter of minutes. No, no one pays me to mention this, but hot damn is it cool.) https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/13/graceful-failure/#frame[401] The reason readers come back to my books is that they're full of hope. In the same way that writing lets me feel like I'm not a passenger in life, but rather, someone with a say in my destination, the books that I write are full of practical ways and dramatic scenes in which other people seize the means of computation, the reins of power or their own destinies. The protagonist of The Lost Cause is Brooks Palazzo, a high-school senior in Burbank whose parents were part of the original cohort of volunteers who kicked off the global transformation, and left him an orphan when they succumbed to one of the zoonotic plagues that arise every time another habitat is destroyed. Brooks grew up knowing what his life would be: the work of repair and care, which millions of young people are doing. Relocating entire cities off endangered coastlines and floodplains, or out of fire-zones. Fighting floods and fires. Caring for tens of millions of refugees for whom the change came too late. But with every revolution comes a counter-revolution. The losers of a just war don't dig holes, climb inside and pull the dirt down on top of themselves. Two groups of reactionaries &#8211; seagoing anarcho-capitalist billionaire wreckers and seething white nationalist militias &#8211; have formed an alliance. They've already gotten their champion into the White House. Next up: dismantling every cause for hope Brooks and his friends have, and bringing back the fear. That's the setup for a novel about solidarity, care, library socialism, and snatching victory from defeat's jaws. Writing it help keep me sane during the lockdown, and when it came time to record the audiobook, I spent a lot of time thinking about who could read it. I've had some great narrators: Wil Wheaton, Neil Gaiman, Amber Benson, Bronson Pinchot, and more. I record my audiobooks with Skyboat Media, a brilliant studio near my place in LA. Back in August, I spent a week in their recording booth &#8211; "The Tardis" &#8211; doing something I'd never tried before: I recorded a whole audiobook, with directorial supervision: The Internet Con: https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/78992826/DEA0CE12/purchase[402] When it was done, the director &#8211; audiobook legend Gabrielle de Cuir &#8211; sat me down and said, "Look, I've never said this to an author before, but I think you should read The Lost Cause. I don't direct anyone anymore except for Wil Wheaton and LeVar Burton, but I would direct you on this one." I was immensely flattered &#8211; and very nervous. Reading The Internet Con was one thing &#8211; the book is built around the speeches I've been giving for 20 years and I knew I could sell those lines &#8211; but The Lost Cause is a novel, with a whole cast of characters. Could I do it? Reader, I did it. I just listened to the proofs last week and: It. Came. Out. Great. The Lost Cause goes on sale on November 14th, and I'll be selling this audiobook I made everywhere audiobooks are sold &#8211; except for the stores that require DRM, nonconsensually shackling readers and writers to their platforms. So you'll be able to get it on Libro.fm, downpour.com, even Google Play &#8211; but not Audible, Apple Books, or Audiobooks.com. But in addition to those worthy retailers, I will be sending out thousands &#8211; and thousands! &#8211; of audiobook to my Kickstarter backers on the on-sale date, either as a folder of DRM-free MP3s, or as a download code for Libro.fm, to make things easy for people who don't want to have to figure out how to sideload an audiobook into a standalone app. And, of course, the mobile duopoly have made this kind of sideloading exponentially harder over the past decade, though far be it from me to connect this with their policy of charging 30% commissions on everything sold through an app, a commission they don't receive if you get your files on the web and load 'em yourself: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/red-team-blues-another-audiobook-that-amazon-wont-sell/posts/3788112[403] As with my previous Kickstarters, I'm also selling ebooks and hardcovers &#8211; signed or unsigned, and this time I've found a great partner to fulfill EU orders from within the EU, so backers won't have to pay VAT and customs charges. The wonderful Otherland &#8211; who have hosted me on my last two trips to Berlin &#8211; are going to manage that shipping for me: https://www.otherland-berlin.de/en/home.html[404] Kim Stanley Robinson read the book and said, "Along with the rush of adrenaline I felt a solid surge of hope. May it go like this." That's just about the perfect quote, because the book is a ride. It's not just a kumbaya tale of a better world that is possible: it's a post-cyberpunk novel of high-tech guerrilla and meme warfare, climate tech and bad climate tech, wildcat prefab urban infill, and far-right militamen who adapt to a ban on assault-rifles by switching to super-soakers full of hydrochloric acid. It's a book about struggle, hope in the darkness, and a way through this rotten moment. It's a book that dares to imagine that things might get worse but also better. This is a curious emotional melange, but it's one that I'm increasingly feeling these days. Like, Amazon, that giant bully, whose blockade on DRM-free audiobooks cost me enough money to pay off my mortgage and put my kid through university (according to my agent)? The incredible Lina Khan brought a long-overdue antitrust case against Amazon while her rockstar DoJ counterpart, Jonathan Kanter, is dragging Google through the courts. The EU is taking on Apple, and French cops are kicking down Nvidia's doors and grabbing their files, looking to build another antitrust case for monopolizing GPUs. The writers won their strike and Joe Biden walked the picket-line with the UAW, the first president in history to join striking workers: https://doctorow.medium.com/joe-biden-is-headed-to-a-uaw-picket-line-in-detroit-f80bd0b372ab?sk=f3abdfd3f26d2f615ad9d2f1839bcc07[405] Solar is now our cheapest energy source, which is wild, because if we could only capture 0.4% of the solar energy that makes it through the atmosphere, we could give everyone alive the same energy budget as Canadians (who have American lifestyles but higher heating bills). As Deb Chachra writes in her forthcoming How Infrastructure Works (my review pending): we get a fresh supply of energy every time the sun rises and we only get new materials when a comet survives atmospheric entry, but we treat energy as scarce and throw away our materials after a single use: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/612711/how-infrastructure-works-by-deb-chachra/[406] Anything that can't go on forever will eventually stop. We have shot past many of our planetary boundaries and there are waves of climate crises in our future, but they don't have to be climate disasters. That's up to us &#8211; it'll depend on whether we come together to save ourselves and each other, or tear ourselves apart. The Lost Cause dares to imagine what it might be like if we do the former. We don't live in a post-enshittification world yet, but we could. With these indie audiobooks, I've found a way to treat the terminal enshittification of the Amazon monopoly as damage and route around it. I hope you'll back the Kickstarter, fight enshittification, inject some hope into your reading, and enjoy a kickass adventure novel in the process: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/the-lost-cause-a-novel-of-climate-and-hope[407] Hey look at this (permalink) Ban Corporate AI Profiteering https://www.aidayofaction.com[408] This is Financial Advice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pYeoZaoWrA[409] DOJ finally posted that “embarrassing” court doc Google wanted to hide https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/google-exec-said-users-get-hooked-on-search-engine-like-cigarettes-or-drugs/[410] This day in history (permalink) #20yrsago EFF’s Trusted Computing white-paper https://web.archive.org/web/20031004073707/https://www.eff.org/Infra/trusted_computing/20031001_tc.php[411] #10yrsago Toronto cops bust Mayor Rob Ford’s fixer/muscle/driver/dealer https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/city-hall/mayor-rob-ford-s-friend-sandro-lisi-who-sought-video-one-of-two-arrested-in/article_845c0feb-b9a0-5d1f-a411-aa18a6ddf58e.html[412] #10yrsago Porno copyright troll John Steele accused of identity theft — by his mother-in-law https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/prendas-john-steele-accused-of-identity-theft-by-his-own-mother-in-law/[413] #10yrsago Asteroid named after Randall “XKCD” Munroe https://blog.xkcd.com/2013/09/30/asteroid-4942-munroe/[414] #10yrsago HOWTO make $200,000 off of the above-inflation USPS postage hike https://qz.com/128329/a-step-by-step-guide-to-profiting-off-the-3-cent-hike-on-us-postage-stamps[415] #10yrsago Talking about Ron Howard’s Haunted Mansion album with the Comedy on Vinyl podcast https://stolendress.com/comedyonvinyl/podcast_episodes/COV_278.mp3[416] #10yrsago The Big Lie: how polygraph companies convinced the US government to use pseudoscience on job applicants https://www.wired.com/story/inside-polygraph-job-screening-black-mirror/[417] #5yrsago Seattle cops announce registry for high-risk swatting targets https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/10/police-to-seattles-techies-streamers-sign-up-for-our-anti-swatting-service/[418] #5yrsago Devin Nunes’s much-touted California farm secretly moved to Iowa in 2006, in a district dependent on undocumented workers https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a23471864/devin-nunes-family-farm-iowa-california/[419] #5yrsago When Mickey Mouse was sent to a Nazi concentration camp https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0305829818799884[420] #5yrsago Capitalism is self-annihilating, not self-perpetuating https://eand.co/if-the-point-of-capitalism-is-to-escape-capitalism-then-whats-the-point-of-capitalism-bedd1b2447d[421] #5yrsago California bans all-male corporate boards https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/30/business/california-requires-women-board-of-directors/index.html[422] #5yrsago The history of a Zorklike programming interpreter is a tale of language, art, code and literature http://www.emshort.com/ifmu/inform.html[423] #5yrsago Brazilian electoral upset possible as fascist loses ground to surging leftist https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/huge-protests-in-brazil-as-far-right-presidential-hopeful-jair-bolsonaro-returns-home[424] #5yrsago Chinese students, made to study Communism, are rising up for workers’ rights https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/world/asia/china-maoists-xi-protests.html[425] #5yrsago “Like Lord of the Flies”: working at the TSA really sucks https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2018/09/report-blasts-tsa-leadership-for-toxic-culture-blames-it-for-high-attrition-poor-morale/[426] #5yrsago Large scale psych study identifies “homo economicus” as the source of all evil in the world https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Frev0000111[427] #5yrsago Justin Trudeau’s NAFTA concessions include 20 year copyright extension https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2018/10/from-copyright-term-to-super-bowl-commercials-breaking-down-the-digital-nafta-deal/[428] #5yrsago All levels of UK government have been paralysed by Brexit https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-19/brexit-has-brought-britain-to-a-standstill#xj4y7vzkg[429] #5yrsago California’s Net Neutrality bill is now law https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/california-governor-signs-net-neutrality-rules-into-law/[430] #1yrago How Palantir will steal the NHS https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/01/the-palantir-will-see-you-now/#public-private-partnership[431] Colophon (permalink) Today's top sources: Currently writing: A Little Brother short story about DIY insulin PLANNING Picks and Shovels, a Martin Hench noir thriller about the heroic era of the PC.

This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading The internet is not a (link)dump truck (permalink) The second decade of the 21st century is truly a bounteous time. My backyard has produced a bumper crop of an invasive species of mosquito that is genuinely innovative: rather than confining itself to biting in the dusk and dawn golden hours, these stinging clouds of flying vampires bite at every hour that God sends: https://themagnet.substack.com/p/the-magnet-081-war-with-mosquitoes[462] Here in the twilight of capitalism's planet-devouring, half-century orgy of wanton destruction, there's more news every day than I can possibly write a full blog post about every day, and as with many weeks, I have arrived at Saturday with a substantial backlog of links that didn't fit into the week's "Hey look at this" linkdumps. Thus, the eighth installment in my ongoing, semiregular series of Saturday linkdumps: https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/[463] This week, the miscellany begins with the first hesitant signs of an emerging, post-neoliberal order. The FTC, under direction of the force-of-nature that is Lina Khan, has brought its long-awaited antitrust case against Amazon. I am very excited about this. Disoriented, even. When was the last time you greeted every day with a warm feeling because high officials in the US government were working for the betterment of every person in the land? It's enough to make one giddy. Plus, the New York Times let me call Amazon "the apex predator of our platform era"! Now that it's in the "paper of record," it's official: https://pluralistic.net/ApexPredator[464] Now, lefties have been predicting capitalism's imminent demise since The Communist Manifesto, but any fule kno that the capitalist word for "crisis" also translates as "opportunity." Like the bedbugs that mutated to thrive in clouds of post-war DDT, capitalism has adapted to each crisis, emerging in a new, more virulent form: https://boingboing.net/2023/09/30/bedbugs-take-paris.html[465] But "anything that can't go on forever will eventually stop" (Stein's Law). Perhaps our mistake was in waiting for capitalism to give way to socialism, rather than serving as a transitional phase between feudalism and&#8230;feudalism. What's the difference between feudalism and capitalism? According to Yanis Varoufakis, it comes down to whether we value rents (income you get from owning things) over profits (income you get from doing things): https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/28/cloudalists/#cloud-capital[466] By that metric, the FTC's case against Amazon is really a case against feudalism. Through predatory pricing and acquisitions, Amazon has turned itself into a chokepoint that every merchant, writer and publisher has to pass through in order to reach their customers. Amazon charges a fortune to traverse that chokepoint (estimates range from 45% to 51% of gross revenues) and then forces sellers to raise their prices everywhere else when they hike their Amazon prices so they can afford Amazon's tolls. It's "an economy-wide hidden tax": https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-ftc-sues-to-break-up-amazon-over[467] Now, feudalism isn't a straightforward proposition. Like, are you sure you mean feudalism? Maybe you mean "manorialism" (they're easy to mix up): https://locusmag.com/2021/01/cory-doctorow-neofeudalism-and-the-digital-manor/[468] Plus, much of what we know about the "Dark Ages" comes from grifter doofuses like Voltaire, a man who was capable of dismissing the 800 year Holy Roman Empire with a single quip ("neither holy, roman, nor an empire"). But the reality is a lot more complicated, gnarly and interesting. That's where medievalist Eleanor Janeaga comes in, and her "Against Voltaire, or, the shortest possible introduction to the Holy Roman Empire" is a banger: https://going-medieval.com/2023/09/29/against-voltaire-or-the-shortest-possible-introduction-to-the-holy-roman-empire/[469] Now, while it's true that Enlightenment thinkers gave medieval times a bum rap, it's likewise true that a key element of Enlightenment justice is transparency: justice being done, and being seen to be done. One way to distinguish "modern" justice from "medieval" trials is to ask whether the public is allowed to watch the trial, see the evidence, and understand the conclusion. Here again, there is evidence that capitalism was a transitional phase between feudalism and feudalism. The Amazon trial has already been poisoned by farcical redactions, in which every key figure is blacked out of the public record: https://prospect.org/power/2023-09-27-redacted-case-against-amazon/[470] This is part of a trend. The other gigantic antitrust case underway right now, against Google, has turned into a star chamber as well, with Judge Amit P Mehta largely deferring to Google's frequent demands to close the court and seal the exhibits: https://usvgoogle.org/trial-update-9-22[471] Google's rationale for this is darkly hilarious: if the public is allowed to know what's happening in its trial, this will be converted into "clickbait," which is to say, "The public is interested in this case, and if they are informed of the evidence against us, that information will be spread widely because it is so interesting": https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/secrecy-is-systemic[472] Thankfully, this secrecy is struggling to survive the public outrage it prompted. While the court's Zoom feed has been shuttered and while Judge Mehta is still all too willing to clear the courtroom during key testimony, at least the DoJ's exhibits aren't being sealed at the same clip as before: https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23892215/google-search-antitrust-trial-documents-public-again-judge-mehta-rules[473] In 2023, the world comes at you fast. There's an epic struggle over the future of corporate dominance playing out all around us. I mean, there are French antitrust enforcers kicking down doors of giant tech companies and ransacking their offices for evidence of nefarious anticompetitive plots: https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23894863/nvidia-offices-raided-french-competition-authority[474] As ever, the question is "socialism or barbarism." But don't say that too loud: in America, socialism is a slur, one that dates back to the Reconstruction era, when pro-slavery factions called Black voting "socialism in South Carolina." Ever since, white nationalists used "socialism" make Americans believe that "socialism" was an "extremist" view, so they'd stand by while everyone from Joe McCarthy to Donald Trump smeared their opponents as "Marxists": https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4066499-trump-paints-2024-campaign-as-righteous-crusade/[475] As Heather Cox Richardson puts it for The Atlantic, "There is a long-standing fight over whether support for the modern-day right is about taxes or race. The key is that it is about taxes and race at the same time": https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/american-socialism-racist-origins/675453/[476] The cruelty isn't the point, in other words. Cruelty is the tactic. The point is power. Remember, no war but class war. All of this is in service to paying workers less so that bosses and investors can have more. Take "essential workers," everyone from teachers to zookeepers, nurses to librarians, EMTs to daycare workers. All of these "caring" professions are paid sub-living wages, and all of these workers are told that "they matter too much to earn a living wage": https://www.okdoomer.io/praise-doesnt-pay/[477] The "you matter too much to pay" mind-zap is called "vocational awe," a crucial term introduced by Ettarh Fobazi in her 2018 paper: https://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2018/vocational-awe/[478] Vocational awe is how creative workers &#8211; like the writers who just won their strike and the actors who are still fighting &#8211; are conned into working at starvation wages. As the old joke goes, "What, and give up show-business?" https://ask.metafilter.com/117904/Whats-the-joke-thas-hase-the-punchline-what-and-give-up-show-business[479] In this moment of Big Tech-driven, AI-based wage suppression, mass surveillance, corruption and inequality, perhaps we should take a moment to remind ourselves that cyberpunk was a warning, not a suggestion. Or, more to the point, the warning was about high-tech corporate takeovers of our lives, and the suggestion was that we could seize the means of computation (a synonym for William Gibson's "the street finds its own use for things"): http://www.seizethemeansofcomputation.org/[480] We are living in a lopsided cyberpunk future, long on high-tech corporate takeover, short of computation seizing. This point is made sharply in JWZ's "Dispatch From The Cyberpunk City," which is beautifully packaged as a Hypercard stack that you run on an in-browser Mac Plus emulator from the Internet Archive: https://www.jwz.org/blog/2023/09/neuroblast-dispatch-from-the-cyberpunk-city/[481] Cast your gaze ahead, to the near future: Public space has all but disappeared. Corporate landlords use AI-powered robots to harass the homeless. The robots, built slick and white with an R2-D2 friendliness now most resemble giant butt plugs covered in graffiti and grime. Science fiction doesn't have to be a warning. It can also be a wellspring of hope. That's what I tried to do with The Lost Cause, my forthcoming Green New Deal novel, which Bill McKibben called "The first great YIMBY novel": https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865939/the-lost-cause[482] Writing a hopeful novel of ecological, social and economic redemption, driven by solidarity, repair, and library socialism, was a powerful tonic against despair in this smoke-smothered, flooded, mosquito-bitten time. And while the book isn't out yet, there are early indications I succeeded, like Kim Stanley Robinson's reaction, "Along with the rush of adrenaline I felt a solid surge of hope. May it go like this." And now, we have a concurring judgment from The Library Journal, who yesterday published their review, which concludes: "a thought-provoking story, with a message of hope in a near-future that looks increasingly bleak": https://www.libraryjournal.com/review/the-lost-cause-2196385[483] This day in history (permalink) #20yrsago Bruce Sterling's 10 technologies that deserve to die https://web.archive.org/web/20031002013533/https://www.technologyreview.com/articles/print_version/Sterling1003.asp[484] #15yrsago Adventurer’s Club at Disney World closes https://attractionsmagazine.com/huge-crowd-gives-heartfelt-send-off-to-adventurers-club/[485] #15yrsago MPAA spokeslawyers insist that they not be identified by name in reports from press-conference https://web.archive.org/web/20081002150019/http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/09/mpaa-realnetwor.html[486] #15yrsago Reuters sues academic for making a Firefox plugin that lets you annotate and reference articles https://crookedtimber.org/2008/09/30/gmu-sued-for-zotero/[487] #15yrsago HOWTO Make a dollhouse out of a gourd https://bitterbettyindustries.blogspot.com/2008/09/gourd-dollhouse-tutorial.html[488] #15yrsago Terry Pratchett’s NATION: moving and sweet young adult novel about science, superstition and decency https://memex.craphound.com/2008/09/30/terry-pratchetts-nation-moving-and-sweet-young-adult-novel-about-science-superstition-and-decency/[489] #10yrsago The Incrementalists: Steven Brust and Skyler White’s novel about an immortal secret society https://memex.craphound.com/2013/09/30/the-incrementalists-steven-brust-and-skyler-whites-novel-about-an-immortal-secret-society/[490] #5yrsago Matt Damon’s eerily good Kavanaugh SNL sketch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRJecfRxbr8[491] #5yrsago $100 bills outnumber $1s, and they’re stuffed in our mattresses https://qz.com/1395050/there-are-now-more-100-bills-than-1-bills-in-the-world[492] Colophon (permalink) Today's top sources: Kottke (https://kottke.org/[493]), Naked Capitalism (https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/[494]).

## Biden: Look at These Pretty Wind Turbines (Also, We’re Expanding Oil Drilling)

date: 2023-09-29

An announcement Friday by the Biden administration to extend the nation’s offshore oil leasing program perfectly encapsulates the Catch-22 the president finds himself in over his climate goals. The press release brazenly advertises the drilling expansion plan as “Reflecting America’s Rapid and Accelerating Shift to Clean Energy,” all while reading like someone trying to convince you that they’ve got a gun to their head.

```html
</p><p>
    This plan was a long time coming. The Interior Department is responsible for establishing a five-year leasing schedule under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act that will “best” meet the United States' energy needs, and the previous plan is about to expire. Lease sale 261, which was supposed to be held on Wednesday but has been delayed until later this fall, is the last one on the agenda.
</p><p>
    The agency could, in theory, issue a schedule with zero lease sales over the next five years. But due to provisions added into the Inflation Reduction Act by West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, such inaction would prevent the government from being able to open up more of the nation’s coast to offshore wind development. Before the Interior Department can put up any offshore acreage for wind, it has to have put up at least 60 million acres for oil in the previous year, the law says.
</p><p>
    So instead of calling it an offshore oil lease plan, the agency is describing it as an offshore wind-enablement plan. The IRA’s handcuffs were referenced roughly four times in the press release, including in the first sentence, which reads, “Consistent with the requirements of the Inflation Reduction Act …” The plan to hold three oil and gas sales in 2025, 2027, and 2029 is the “minimum number” the department could schedule in order to continue the expansion of offshore wind, it said, and “the fewest … in history.” The subheading of the page even calls it a plan that “phases down oil and gas leasing in the Gulf of Mexico,” and the image paired with the announcement on social media featured wind turbines.
</p><center><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet" data-partner="rebelmouse" data-twitter-tweet-id="1707775671739568519">
<div style="margin:1em 0"></div> —  (@)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/USInteriorPress/status/1707775671739568519"></a>
</blockquote>
<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></center><p>
    There’s nothing factually wrong about any of this. The final plan calls for significantly fewer sales than the 47 initially proposed in 2018 by the Trump administration, and a marked reduction from the 11 proposed by Biden last summer. The plan also restricts drilling to areas in the Gulf of Mexico that are already under development, rather than opening up new areas in Alaska or the Atlantic, as Trump wanted to do. But it does put the U.S. on a path to increased oil production, and at least one <a href="https://usa.oceana.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/04/2023-Drilling-Report-DOI.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> asserts that the administration doesn’t even need to hold any more wind lease sales to achieve Biden’s clean energy goals.<br/>
</p><p>It’s unclear who the apologetic tone or desperate image of wind turbines was for. By all accounts, the announcement was a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-offshore-drilling-gulf-mexico-climate-interior-6f0ca38e5b32c35ae7ff925ba2476c4c" target="_blank">letdown</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/09/29/biden-offshore-oil-drilling-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all sides</a>.</p>

## Pluralistic: The surveillance advertising to financial fraud pipeline (29 Sept 2023)

date: 2023-09-29

Today's links The surveillance advertising to financial fraud pipeline: Finding suckers is the one thing ad-targeting is good at. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading The surveillance advertising to financial fraud pipeline (permalink) Being watched sucks. Of all the parenting mistakes I've made, none haunt me more than the times my daughter caught me watching her while she was learning to do something, discovered she was being observed in a vulnerable moment, and abandoned her attempt: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/may/09/cybersecurity-begins-with-integrity-not-surveillance[525] It's hard to be your authentic self while you're under surveillance. For that reason alone, the rise and rise of the surveillance industry &#8211; an unholy public-private partnership between cops, spooks, and ad-tech scum &#8211; is a plague on humanity and a scourge on the Earth: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/16/the-second-best-time-is-now/#the-point-of-a-system-is-what-it-does[526] But beyond the psychic damage surveillance metes out, there are immediate, concrete ways in which surveillance brings us to harm. Ad-tech follows us into abortion clinics and then sells the info to the cops back home in the forced birth states run by Handmaid's Tale LARPers: https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/29/no-i-in-uter-us/#egged-on[527] And even if you have the good fortune to live in a state whose motto isn't "There's no 'I" in uter-US," ad-tech also lets anti-abortion propagandists trick you into visiting fake "clinics" who defraud you into giving birth by running out the clock on terminating your pregnancy: https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/15/paid-medical-disinformation/#crisis-pregnancy-centers[528] The commercial surveillance industry fuels SWATting, where sociopaths who don't like your internet opinions or are steamed because you beat them at Call of Duty trick the cops into thinking that there's an "active shooter" at your house, provoking the kind of American policing autoimmune reaction that can get you killed: https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/14/us/swatting-sentence-casey-viner/index.html[529] There's just a lot of ways that compiling deep, nonconsensual, population-scale surveillance dossiers can bring safety and financial harm to the unwilling subjects of our experiment in digital spying. The wave of "business email compromises" (the infosec term for impersonating your boss to you and tricking you into cleaning out the company bank accounts)? They start with spear phishing, a phishing attack that uses personal information &#8211; bought from commercial sources or ganked from leaks &#8211; to craft a virtual Big Store con: https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/safety-resources/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/business-email-compromise[530] It's not just spear-phishers. There are plenty of financial predators who run petty grifts &#8211; stock swindles, identity theft, and other petty cons. These scams depend on commercial surveillance, both to target victims (e.g. buying Facebook ads targeting people struggling with medical debt and worried about losing their homes) and to run the con itself (by getting the information needed to pull off a successful identity theft). In "Consumer Surveillance and Financial Fraud," a new National Bureau of Academic Research paper, a trio of business-school profs &#8211; Bo Bian (UBC), Michaela Pagel (WUSTL) and Huan Tang (Wharton) quantify the commercial surveillance industry's relationship to finance crimes: https://www.nber.org/papers/w31692[531] The authors take advantage of a time-series of ZIP-code-accurate fraud complaint data from the Consumer Finance Protection Board, supplemented by complaints from the FTC, along with Apple's rollout of App Tracking Transparency, a change to app-based tracking on Apple mobile devices that turned off third-party commercial surveillance unless users explicitly opted into being spied on. More than 96% of Apple users blocked spying: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/[532] In other words, they were able to see, neighborhood by neighborhood, what happened to financial fraud when users were able to block commercial surveillance. What happened is, fraud plunged. Deprived of the raw material for committing fraud, criminals were substantially hampered in their ability to steal from internet users. While this is something that security professionals have understood for years, this study puts some empirical spine into the large corpus of qualitative accounts of the surveillance-to-fraud pipeline. As the authors note in their conclusion, this analysis is timely. Google has just rolled out a new surveillance system, the deceptively named "Privacy Sandbox," that every Chrome user is being opted in to unless they find and untick three separate preference tickboxes. You should find and untick these boxes: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/how-turn-googles-privacy-sandbox-ad-tracking-and-why-you-should[533] Google has spun, lied and bullied Privacy Sandbox into existence; whenever this program draws enough fire, they rename it (it used to be called FLoC). But as the Apple example showed, no one wants to be spied on &#8211; that's why Google makes you find and untick three boxes to opt out of this new form of surveillance. There is no consensual basis for mass commercial surveillance. The story that "people don't mind ads so long as they're relevant" is a lie. But even if it was true, it wouldn't be enough, because beyond the harms to being our authentic selves that come from the knowledge that we're being observed, surveillance data is a crucial ingredient for all kinds of crime, harassment, and deception. We can't rely on companies to spy on us responsibly. Apple may have blocked third-party app spying, but they effect nonconsensual, continuous surveillance of every Apple mobile device user, and lie about it: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar[534] That's why we should ban commercial surveillance. We should outlaw surveillance advertising. Period: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/ban-online-behavioral-advertising[535] Contrary to the claims of surveillance profiteers, this wouldn't reduce the income to ad-supported news and other media &#8211; it would increase their revenues, by letting them place ads without relying on the surveillance troves assembled by the Google/Meta ad-tech duopoly, who take the majority of ad-revenue: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/save-news-we-must-ban-surveillance-advertising[536] We're 30 years into the commercial surveillance pandemic and Congress still hasn't passed a federal privacy law with a private right of action. But other agencies aren't waiting for Congress. The FTC and DoJ Antitrust Divsision have proposed new merger guidelines that allow regulators to consider privacy harms when companies merge: https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FTC-2023-0043-1569[537] Think here of how Google devoured Fitbit and claimed massive troves of extremely personal data, much of which was collected because employers required workers to wear biometric trackers to get the best deal on health care: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/google-fitbit-merger-would-cement-googles-data-empire[538] Companies can't be trusted to collect, retain or use our personal data wisely. The right "balance" here is to simply ban that collection, without an explicit opt-in. The way this should work is that companies can't collect private data unless users hunt down and untick three "don't spy on me" boxes. After all, that's the standard that Google has set.

<p>As a government shutdown looms, mortgage rates have been rising. Those climbing rates have been chilling the housing market. We check in with lenders to see what mortgage demand is like. Then, to combat worker shortages, the Biden administration is releasing a worker training playbook. And later: The editor-in-chief of The Economist explains why she&#8217;s more concerned about the growing cost of U.S. debt than the shutdown.</p>

## DEATH AND THE CITY

date: 2023-09-29

It&#8217;s almost three months since I made my first appearance on Substack, descending gingerly from the novelist&#8217;s ivory tower I&#8217;d been content to look down from for years and vowing to walk the streets like Baudelaire&#8217;s fl&#226;neur, sauntering for the sheer joy of it, absorbing the spectacle of urban multitudinousness. That was not an entirely true account of what has always drawn me to the city&#8217;s streets and was beckoning to me again. Catastrophe is what brings the morbidly curious to the city - the excitement of life when it is most imperilled - and while I have never been a stranger to morbidity, age has made me more in thrall to it than ever. Drinking deep of the very thing I dread, I pause at every memorial - a park bench fondly recalling a lost friend or lover, a makeshift shrine of faded flowers or soft toys placed on the spot where someone dear was run over, stabbed or shot down, a grand or puny commemoration of calamity ages old or dating only from yesterday. The more vibrant a city&#8217;s life, the more it pulses with the imminence of death. So for every hour I spend like Baudelaire, sitting cross-legged at a corner cafe, sipping absinthe and vaping a Gauloise, lost in the multifariousness of the streets, I spend two more in ghoulish pursuit of transience, tracking my own ghost. . .

Answering some questions about the Raspberry Pi 5

```
        <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>It's less than 12 hours since the Pi 5 launch, and already there's a few hundred questions whizzing about—I thought I'd answer some of the things I see people asking most frequently, like:</p>
```

```html
<h3>Does the new Case have room for the Active Cooler, or other Pi HATs?</h3>
```

```html
<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-case-active-cooler.jpeg" width="700" height="467" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-563441bf-a90d-4fb2-840d-691ea57d5058" data-insert-attach="{"id":"563441bf-a90d-4fb2-840d-691ea57d5058","attributes":{"alt":["alt","description"],"title":["title"]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 case with active cooler" /></p>
```

```html
<p>Yes, indeed it does! You can pop out the fan bracket in the new Case, and fit many normal-size Pi HATs. This is useful also if you want to stack cases—assuming the HAT has mounting points, you could put some spacers in and stack another Pi or Pi + Case on top!</p></div>

<p>In many parts of the U.S., it’s still legal to pay workers with disabilities a subminimum wage. But the Department of Labor said this week that it’s planning a comprehensive review of the policy. We dig in. Then, we take a look at the investments needed to avoid climate catastrophe. Plus, what would a government shutdown look like for federal employees?</p>

## Feedback on automatic digital preservation and self-healing DOIs

date: 2023-09-28

```html
<p>Thank you to everyone who responded with feedback on the Op Cit proposal. This post clarifies, defends, and amends the original proposal in light of the responses that have been sent. We have endeavoured to respond to every point that was raised, either here or in the document comments themselves.</p>
<p><b>We strongly prefer for this to be developed in collaboration with CLOCKSS, LOCKSS, and/or Portico, i.e. through established preservation services that already have existing arrangements in place, are properly funded, and understand the problem space. There is low level of trust in the Internet Archive, also given a number of ongoing court cases and erratic behavior in the past. People are questioning the sustainability and stability of IA, and given it is not funded by publishers or other major STM stakeholders there is low confidence in IA setting their priorities in a way that is aligned with that of the publishing industry.</b></p>
<p>We acknowledge that some of our members have a low level of trust in The Internet Archive, but many of our (primarily open access members) work very closely with the IA and our research has shown that, without the IA, the majority our smaller open access members would have almost no preservation at all. We have already had conversations with CLOCKSS and Portico about involvement in the pilot and thinking through what a scale-to-production would look like. That said, for a proof-of-concept, the Internet Archive presents a very easy way to get off the ground, with a stable system that has been running for almost 30 years.</p>
<p><b>This seems to be a service for OA content only, but people wonder for how long. Someone already spotted an internal CrossRef comment on the working doc that suggested “why not just make it default for everything &amp; everyone”, and that raises concern.</b></p>
<p>The primary audience for this service is small OA publishers that are, at present, poorly preserved. These publishers present a problem for the whole scholarly environment because linking to their works can prove non-persistent if preservation is not well handled. Enhancing preservation for this sector therefore benefits the entire publishing industry by creating a persistent linking environment. We have no plans to make this the “default for everything and everyone” because the licensing challenges alone are massive, but also because it isn’t necessary. Large publishers like Elsevier are doing a good job of digitally preserving their content. We want this service to target the areas that are currently weaker.</p>
<p>Crossref will always respect the content rights of our members. We never force our members to release their content through Crossref that they don&rsquo;t ask us to release.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Op Cit project is to make it easier for our members to fulfil commitments they already made when they joined Crossref.</p>
<p>Crossref is fundamentally an infrastructure for preserving citations and links in the scholarly record. We cannot do that if the content being cited or linked to disappears.</p>
<p>When signing the Crossref membership agreement, members agree to employ their best efforts to preserve their content with archiving services so that Crossref can continue to link citations to it even in extremis. For example- if they have ceased operations.</p>
<p>Some of our members already do this well. They have already made arrangements with the major archiving providers. They do not need the Op Cit service to help them with archiving. However, the Op Cit service will still help them ensure that the DOIs that they cite continue work. So it will still benefit them even if they don&rsquo;t use it directly.</p>
<p>However, our research shows that many of our members are not fulfilling the commitments they made when joining Crossref. Over the next few years, we will be trying to fix this. Primarily through outreach- encouraging members to set up and record with Crossref archiving arrangements with the archives of their choice.</p>
<p>But we know some members will find this too technically challenging and/or costly. [And frankly, given what we&rsquo;ve learned of the archiving landscape, we can see their point.] The proposed Op Cit service is for these members. The vast majority of these members are Open Access publishers, so the &ldquo;rights&rdquo; questions are far more straightforward- making the implementation of such a service much more tractable.</p>
<p><b>Someone asked what this means for the publisher-specific DOI prefix for this content? Will this be lost?</b></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><b>There is concern about the interstitial page that Crossref would build that gives the user access options. The value of Crossref to publishers is adding services that are invisible and beneficial to users, not adding a visible step that requires user action.</b></p>
<p>There is nothing in Crossref’s terms that says that we have to be invisible. The basic truth is that detecting content drift is really hard and several efforts to do so before have failed. Without a reliable way of knowing whether we should display the interstitial page, which may become possible in future, we have to display something for now, or the preservation function will not work.</p>
<p>Crossref has, also, supported user-facing interstitial services for over a decade, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple Resolution</li>
<li>Coaccess</li>
<li>CrossMark</li>
<li>Crossref Metdata Search</li>
<li>REST API</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have a long track record of non-B2B service provision.</p>
<p><b>There is confusion about why Crossref seems to want to build the capacity to “lock” records in absence of flexibility. People feel no need for Crossref to get involved here.</b></p>
<p>This is a misunderstanding of the terminology. The Internet Archive allows the domain owner to request content to be removed. This would mean that, in future, if a new domain owner wanted, they could remove previously preserved material from the archive, thereby breaking the preservation function. When we say we want to “lock” a record, we mean that a future domain owner cannot remove content from the preservation archive. This also prevents domain hijackers from compromising the digital preservation.</p>
<p><b>There is concern about the possibility to hack this system to give uncontrolled access to all full-text content by attacking publishing systems and making them unavailable. This is an unhappy path scenario but something on people’s minds.</b></p>
<p>The system only works on content that is provided with an explicitly stated open license (see response above).</p>
<p><b>I think this project would be improved by better addressing the people doing the preservation maintenance work that this requires. Digital preservation is primarily a labor problem, as the technical challenges are usually easier than the challenge of consistently paying people to keep everything maintained over time. Through that lens, this is primarily a technical solution to offload labor resources from small repositories to (for now) the Internet Archive, where you can get benefits from the economies of scale. There are definitely cases where that could be useful! But I think making this more explicit will further a shared understanding of advantages and disadvantages and help you all see future roadblocks and opportunities for this approach.</b></p>
<p>This consultation phase was designed, precisely, to ensure that those working in the space could have their say. While this is a technical project, we recognize that any solution must value and understand labor. That means that any scaling to production must and will also include a funding solution to address the social labor challenge.</p>
<p><b>Is there any sense in polling either the IA Wayback Machine or the LANL Memento Aggregator first to determine if snapshot(s) already exist?</b></p>
<p>We could do this, but it would add an additional hop/lookup on deposit. Plus, we want to store the specific version deposited at the specific time it is done, including re-deposits.</p>
<p><b>I would encourage looking at a distributed file system like IPFS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System%29" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System)</a>. This would allow easy duplication, switching and peering of preservation providers. Correctly leveraged with IPNS; resolution, version tracking and version immutability also become benefits. Later after beta the IPNS metadata could be included as DOI metadata.</b></p>
<p>We had considered IPFS for other projects, but really, for this, we want to go with recognised archives, not end up running our own infrastructure for preservation.</p>
<p><b>It might be useful to look into the 10320/loc option for the Handle server: the <a href="https://www.handle.net/overviews/handle_type_10320_loc.html" target="_blank">https://www.handle.net/overviews/handle_type_10320_loc.html</a>. I can imagine a use case where a machine agent might want to access an archive directly without needing to go to an interstitial page.</b></p>
<p>It is good to see reference to the HANDLE system and alternative ways that we might use it. We will consult internally on the technical viability of this.</p>
<p>In general, though, we prefer to use web-native mechanisms when they are available. We already support direct machine access via HTTP redirects and by exposing resource URLs in the metadata that can be retreivd via content negotiation. In this case, we would be looking at supporting the 300 (multiple choice) semantics.</p>
<p><b>I&rsquo;m curious to see how this will work for DOI versioning mechanisms like in Zenodo, where you have one DOI to reference all versions as well as version specific DOIs. If your record contains metadata + many files and a new version just versions one of the several files my assumption is that within the proposed system an entire new set (so all files) is archived. In theory this could also be a logical package, where simply the delta is stored, but I guess in a distributed preservation framework like the one proposed here, this would be hard to achieve.</b></p>
<p>This is a good point and it could lead to many more, frustrating, hops before the user reaches the content. We will conduct further research into this scenario, but we also note that Zenodo&rsquo;s DOIs do not come from Crossref, but from DataCite.</p>
<p><b>There&rsquo;s a decent body of research at this point on automated content drift detection. This recent paper: <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3246/10_Paper3.pdf" target="_blank">https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3246/10_Paper3.pdf</a> likely has links to other relevant articles.</b></p>
<p>We have no illusions about the difficulty of detecting semantic drift but this is helpful and interesting. We will read this material and related articles to appraise the current state of content drift detection.</p>
<p><b>Out of curiosity, will we be using one type of archive (i.e., IA or CLOCKSS or LOCKSS or whatever) or will it possibly be a combination of a few archives? Reading the comments, it looks like some of them charge a fee, so I see why we&rsquo;d use open source solutions first. Also, eventually could it be something that the member chooses? i.e. which archive they might want to use. Again, the latter question isn&rsquo;t something for the prototype, but I&rsquo;m curious about this use case. Also, I wonder about the implementation details if it is more than one archive. The question is totally moot of course, if we&rsquo;re sticking with one archive for now.</b></p>
<p>The design will allow for deposit in multiple archives – and we will have to design a sustainability model that will cover those archives that need funding. As above, this is an important part of the move to production.</p>
<p><b>Will be good for future interoperability to make sure at least one of the hashes is a SoftWare Hash IDentifier (see swhid.org). The ID is not really software specific and will interoperate with the Software Heritage Archive and git repositories.</b></p>
<p>We will certainly ensure best practices for checksums.</p>
<p><b>Comments on the Interstitial Page</b></p>
<p><b>I&rsquo;d keep the interstitial page without planning its eradication. (See why in the last paragraph)
I&rsquo;d even advocate for it to be a beautiful and useful reminder to users that &ldquo;This content is preserved&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;d go further and recommend that publishers deposit alternate urls of other preservation agents like PMC etc, that would also be displayed. This page could even be merged with multi-resolution system.</p>
<p>The why: I&rsquo;m concerned of hackers and of predatory publishers exploiting the spider heuristics by highjacking small journals and keeping just enough metadata as in them as to fool the resolver and then adding links to whatever products, scams and whatnots&hellip;</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Technical. Scraping landing pages is hard. We&rsquo;ve had a lot of projects to do this over the years. You can mitigate the risk by tiering / heuristics. Maybe even feedback loop to publishers to encourage them to put the right metadata on the landing page.</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><b>This is the only part of this proposal that I don&rsquo;t like. People are used to DOIs resolving directly to content, and I don&rsquo;t think that should be changed unless absolutely necessary. I would prefer that the DOI resolves to the publisher&rsquo;s copy if it exists, and the IA copy otherwise.</b></p>
<p>We will continue the discussion about the interstitial page. The basic technical fact, as above, is that detecting content drift is hard and so we may need, at least, to start with the page. However, some commentators presented reasons for keeping it.</p>
<p>We also have already supported interstitial pages for multiple resolution and co-access for over a decade.</p>
<p>It is member&rsquo;s choice whether they wish to deposit alternative URLs and we already have a mechanism for this.</p>

## Critical Vulnerability in libwebp Library

```html
<p>Both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/apple-patches-clickless-0-day-image-processing-vulnerability-in-ios-macos/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_11.html">Google</a> have recently reported critical vulnerabilities in their systems&#8212;iOS and Chrome, respectively&#8212;that are ultimately the result of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/09/incomplete-disclosures-by-apple-and-google-create-huge-blindspot-for-0-day-hunters/">same vulnerability</a> in the libwebp library:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Thursday, researchers from security firm Rezillion published evidence that they said made it &#8220;highly likely&#8221; both indeed stemmed from the same bug, specifically in libwebp, the code library that apps, operating systems, and other code libraries incorporate to process WebP images.</p>
<p>Rather than Apple, Google, and Citizen Lab coordinating and accurately reporting the common origin of the vulnerability, they chose to use a separate CVE designation, the researchers said. The researchers concluded that &#8220;millions of different applications&#8221; would remain vulnerable until they, too, incorporated the libwebp fix. That, in turn, they said, was preventing automated systems that developers use to track known vulnerabilities in their offerings from detecting a critical vulnerability that&#8217;s under active exploitation...</p></blockquote>

## Bots, Spiders, and Crawlers: The Results

date: 2023-09-26

```html
<p>It's been 7 days <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/bots-spiders-and-crawlers">since I updated my robots.txt</a> and the results are in. Has anything changed? Has my site tanked? Time to find out. To make sure the logs were comparable I grabbed 6 full days' worth of data. I wrote the previous post on the 20th and so I grabbed data from September 14th to 19th—I'll refer to this as "before"—and I compared it against data from the 21st to 26th range, the "after". As mentioned in the previous post, I'm using Goaccess to parse the data and I ran it twice for each set of logs: one with the <code>ignore-crawlers</code> option turned on and one with the option turned off. Ok, enough words, here's the data:</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with"><div class="m-m"><img alt="" class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/bots-spiders-and-crawlers-the-results/7ca75ee805-1695796300/data.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1181 / 840"></div></figure>
<p>First thing first, a note on total requests: Goaccess will count all requests no matter what the <code>ignore-crawlers</code> says which is why the number is identical with that turned on and off. Now, for the interesting parts. Overall hits on the server look about the same. There's a ~4500 requests difference over 6 days which is ~4% of the total ~117000 original server requests. The interesting part for me are the "Not Found" that have gone down by a significant %. The panel dedicated to the 404s shows 4525 total hits that went down to 3590 after the change. Not really all that important but still interesting to see.</p>
<p>For Goaccess, a "Unique Visitor" is a hit coming on the same date, from the same combination of IP and User Agent. And according to that metric, I lost ~8% of visitors unique visitors. Don't ask me how accurate that estimate is because I have no idea. That 8% might be bots that were escaping my <code>ignore-crawlers</code> filter list and now got blocked by the robots.txt rule.</p>
<p>Goaccess also has a dedicated "Browsers" panel that shows which browsers are used when accessing my site and also very conveniently bundles all the crawlers together under the "Crawlers" label. Before, Crawlers were 54.6% of the total traffic. After the change? 54.06%. So that tells me that the vast majority of automated tools out there just don't give a fuck about what you put in your robots.txt.</p>
<p>As for the "Referring Sites" panel, the only thing I checked is how much traffic came from Google and that changed a bit: 900 hits before, and 376 after.</p>
<p>So, what's the takeaway here? I guess that the vast majority of crawlers don't give a shit about your robots.txt. As for me and this site, I think I'm gonna revert back and allow bots to just do whatever the hell they want. This seems a worthless battle to fight for no real benefit to my general mission which is to connect with other human beings.</p>
<p>If you have questions about this experiment let me know. I'm happy to poke around the results some more if there's anything you're interested in.</p>

## All TypePad feeds are failing

date: 2023-09-24

As mentioned last time&amp;nbsp;there are always a few blogs&#x27; feeds that we have problems fetching, ultimately giving up until we one day find a solution. Usually they&#x27;re either&amp;nbsp;403 Forbidden&amp;nbsp;errors, or difficulties connecting to the domain, despite the feeds being visible/downloadable in a web browser. But for more than a week,&amp;nbsp;all the feeds we track that are hosted at TypePad have been returning 403 errors. This means that, along with other failing blogs, we can no longer display the latest posts for TypePad blogs.

This wasn&#8217;t entirely surprising &#8211; they were also unable to proceed last year, and they aren&#8217;t the only group to have faced struggles organising their annual event recently; the Wakefield RISC OS Computer Club (WROCC) also had problems with their annual event, but luckily did manage to&#8230;

## Jet Lag and the Joy of Being Offline

date: 2023-09-22

In a world perpetually online, I found solace in Arctic silences. Bookended by sleepless nights and jet lag, my journey led me to question: What truly matters when we unplug? Beyond the glare of screens, between journal entries, I rediscovered forgotten joys and the insignificance of our digital clamor.

## P&B: Brian Koberlein

date: 2023-09-21

```html

Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&#039;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I'm a child of Midwest American farmers, and I'm the first in my family to attend college. I earned a Ph.D. in theoretical physics researching black holes in the early universe and followed the traditional academic/professor path for years. Over the past decade, I migrated from academia to science writing, and I'm now Senior Science Writer for the <a href="https://public.nrao.edu" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">National Radio Astronomy Observatory</a> (NRAO).</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&#039;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I've had personal web pages since the early days. Academic websites for students, archives for research, the occasional essay, and the like. All of these were hosted by my university at the time, so other than a few scraps on the Wayback Machine they have been lost to entropy.</p>
<p>I never planned to start a blog.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, I was writing a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/astrophysics-through-computation/44C60E5CDC27BD38B2502AA3339042BE" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">textbook on computational astrophysics for Cambridge University Press</a>. It was almost like writing a second dissertation, and it meant spending tedious hours focusing on the minutia of equations, citations, and accuracy. After a couple of hours of that, your brain starts to crave distractions. That turned out to be blogging.</p>
<p>A friend of mine had given me an early invite to Google+, so I started playing around with it. Between teaching and grading, I'd work on the textbook for a couple of hours, then log into Google+ just to flatline a bit. I started making posts like "I've just spent the past two hours computing how the radius of a white dwarf varies with mass. Let me tell you about it." The posts got attention because space stuff is cool, then Google started promoting my posts and my follower count went through the roof. By mid-2013 I was the second most popular science blogger on the platform. By the end of 2013, I had 25 million views. Thanks to Google's promotion of my work I had a real audience, and I started to take it seriously.</p>
<p>I started my current website because I wanted a repository of all these Google+ posts I was doing. A backup I could control just in case Google decided to kill its platform, gods forbid. The <a href="https://briankoberlein.com/post/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">posts</a> section of my site is that repository. At first, I was "blogging" on Google+ and publishing copies to the website. As the platform started to lose its shine, I switched to publishing directly on my site, then posting links on Google+ </p>
<p>By 2015 my blog was popular enough I started getting asked to write posts for various websites. Science writing started as a side job, but it was certainly less stressful than academia, so when NRAO asked me to work for them, I took it. My current job is a direct result of my blog. </p>
<p>My website continues to be a repository of things I write online. Unless it's paid work where an institution gets exclusive rights to the work, I post a copy on my site. It's also more than just science writing. I also post essays, general thoughts, and even short fiction.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>For science posts, inspiration usually comes from either a specific research paper or questions from readers. If it's a topic I'm really familiar with, then I generally bang it out, proof it, then publish within a couple of hours. If it is a more complex or subtle topic, then it usually takes me a day or two of off-and-on work. If the article is for NRAO, Scientific American, or the like, then there is an editorial process that happens over weeks.</p>
<p>When I write fiction the process is very different. For that, I have a few close friends that read drafts and give feedback. A few things end up being posted on the site. A lot of fiction I write goes into a folder, and may or may not get posted down the line. I'm still figuring out the fiction side of things.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I work from home, so I have a home office with a little table for my laptop in one corner and a big rolltop desk in the other. All the general work of emails, Zoom, and administration I do at the laptop table. Writing is done at the rolltop desk.</p>
<p>For me, physical space and process are central to how I work. It's to the point that the type of writing I'm doing determines the process. If I'm writing a blog post, something intended to be immediate and online, then I type it. Fiction seems more thoughtful to me, and I do all of that with a fountain pen and paper. The tools I use set the mindset for me, and the way I've oriented the rolltop desk creates a small quiet space where I don't have any distractions. I think I enjoy the physical process of writing as much as I enjoy creating written work.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>My website is static and generated through <a href="https://gohugo.io" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Hugo</a>. I enter posts in Markdown using <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> and push them to a Git repository on GitLab. Then <a href="https://www.netlify.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Netlify</a> is flagged and generates and publishes the site. My domain is registered through <a href="https://www.hover.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Hover</a>. </p>
<p>I'm a big believer in having separate tools for separate jobs. So domain registration, composition, and hosting are all separate services. That way I'm never dependent on a single platform for everything. Before I switched to a static site, it was generated through WordPress and hosted on a VPS.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>The first incarnation of my website was in WordPress using a template. WordPress is easy, but it tends to lock you in. If I were to start again, I would start with a text-driven site with almost no formatting. Because a website is public, and the internet remembers, it's difficult to think of your website as a work in progress. But that's the real power of creation. I had a huge advantage with Google+ in that I was forced to focus just on the writing, and the layout was not up to me. By the time I started creating my website, I had a good idea of what I was trying to create and say. Websites can evolve. They aren't forever printed and bound like books.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetizing personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>When the site was hugely popular and running on WordPress, costs were around $200-$300 a month. That was one of the big motivators to switch to a static format. Now costs are pretty minimal. Annual domain registration for briankoberlein.com (and similar domains I don't want poached) runs about $90 a year. With images my site is about 4 Gb, so GitLab storage runs $65 a year. Netlify is $20/month. So in total things cost a few hundred a year, which I can cover out of pocket.</p>
<p>I like when people create honest and interesting content, and if monetization allows them to create, then I support it 100%. Most "<a href="https://briankoberlein.com/tech/quiet-web/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">quiet</a> <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/quiet-web">web</a>" sites are created by people with a certain financial privilege. It limits the range of voices we hear, which is a terrible loss. Paying for creative work is how we show its value to the world. And until we live in a socialist Star Trek utopia, it takes money to have the time and space to do creative work. </p>
<p>Personally, I'm not a fan of generic ads and ad networks, though I understand why some people use them. I like tossing coin to sites I find interesting, particularly if they don't seem popular. So things like LibrePay, <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Ko-fi</a>, whatever. I also really like it when there is something I can buy from you. If I love your blog and you put out an ebook or album, I'm likely to buy it.</p>
<p>The only other thing I will add is that I don't think anyone needs to justify asking for support through "hosting costs money" or the like. Art is worth supporting, so even if the money I send goes to paying for your truffle brownie habit, you do you.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>A couple that people might not have come across:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://brr.fyi/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">brr.fyi</a> Interesting views about life at the South Pole.</li>
<li><a href="https://dailymedieval.blogspot.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Daily Medieval</a> A short post almost every day on the Middle Ages.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I suppose this is primarily directed at younger or newer creatives, regarding “the algorithm” of search engines and social media. I think for most creatives there is a drive to get your work seen. Online that means figuring out a way to go viral, get likes, or rise in the search engine rankings. That’s a perfectly fine goal, but you should know that if the algorithm chooses you it has nothing to do with the quality or value of your work. And I mean literally nothing. The algorithm is nothing more than a capitalist predator, seeking to consume what it can, monetize it quickly, then toss aside. If you make the algorithm your audience, you get very good at creating for an audience of machines rather than humans. Creating for humans is harder, it may get you ignored by the algorithm, but your work will be better for it, and it will find an audience in time.</p></div>
