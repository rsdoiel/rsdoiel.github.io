      <source:markdown># Computer related words that bug me

Sometimes specific terms bug me on popular usage. This is particularly true when related to computer science (or better term, information science). 

Two terms really grate on my nerves these days.

1. “AI” was a marketing term to get the DOD to fund researching in to cognitive approaches to computation.  The generals like the term Artificial Intelligence in the 1970s because the idea of robot solders who could be destroyed with out the having to write the letters to their parents was desirable after Vietnam and previous wars. For the researchers it was sufficiently vague to be a goldmine of grant possibilities.
2. Information Security became Cyber Security for marketing reasons

Terms that change for marketing reasons quickly loose meaning. In the computers as communication devices space this isn&#39;t a good feature.

The stupidest phrase I&#39;ve heard a politician and business leaders say in interviews, &#34;We&#39;ve got to have cyber&#34;.  In my head I change &#34;cyber&#34; to &#34;coffee&#34; so I don&#39;t think have to remember their names.</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[I've come to think of the Web as a network hypertext system instead of thinking about it in terms of the technology that built it.

      <source:markdown># Create Simple Websites using only Markdown

&#62; The [Antenna App](/antennaApp) is shaping the way I write and build websites

By R. S. Doiel, 2025-10-14

The Web as a __networked hypertext system__. A human friendly way of expressing hypertext is [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Markdown has allowed many people to participate in creating content for the web. I think it deserves more focus. Between Markdown and a sprinkle of CSS and you can create entire websites using your own computer or hosted on a static site host  provider[^1]. In this post I show how Markdown can be the central focus in creating basic websites. All it requires is knowing a little Markdown, a text editor, web browser and the [Antenna App](https://rsdoiel.github.io/antennaApp).

[^1]: Example, GitHub Pages, Dreamhost or in S3 buckets setup as static websites at AWS

Demonstrated in this post:

- A means of creating a web page (HTML page) using Markdown and the Antenna App
- A means of creating a simple multi page website with navigation using an Antenna App theme
- A means of styling the web site using CSS expressed as part of an Antenna App theme 

NOTE: Antenna supports creating many types of websites. Examples include [microblogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging), [blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog), [linkblogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog), [wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) and hybrids of these. Pretty much what you need to be social on the web without resorting to the silos of Big Corp.

## What you need to get started

- A computer
- A terminal app
- A text editor
- A web browser
- Antenna App

Chances are you have the first four if you&#39;re reading this. What I describe in this ports should work on computers running Windows, macOS and Linux based systems. If you need to acquire a computer and already have a HDMI television I recommend getting a Raspberry Pi Computer. The Raspberry Pi 500 Kit is a nice middle range device that runs about $120.00 US. It includes a book about using Raspberry Pi computers. If you can afford a bit more the Raspberry Pi 500+ Kit should be out by Christmas 2025 and that&#39;ll probably run in the ballpark of $240.00 US. That&#39;s a nice computer with lots of storage and the bells and whistles to do image, audio and light video work. If you are on a budget then you can squeak by with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W running the software. That setup will set you back about $50.00 US with the minimum accessories needed like case, keyboard, mouse, power supply and cables to connect things up. The Official Raspberry Pi Handbook print edition runs between $25.00 US but the electronic edition that you can read on your phone or tablet is free. My point is that for a little bit of investment or using your existing resources you have the means of building websites for yourself and others. You don&#39;t need to be a programmer or even a web designer if you are comfortable editing text and doing a bit of writing. 

The [Antenna App](https://rsdoiel.github.io/antennaApp) is software I wrote to prove to myself that building websites could be made simpler. I currently use it to curate my own websites include my blog and personal news site, &#60;https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna&#62; and &#60;https://rsdoiel.github.io/antennaApp/INSTALL.html&#62;.

## Installing Antenna App

If you need to install the Antenna App you need to use your terminal to run the following command on macOS and Linux like systems.

~~~shell
curl https://rsdoiel.github.io/antennaApp/installer.sh | sh
~~~

or on Windows in Powershell you can use this command.

~~~shell
irm https://rsdoiel.github.io/antennaApp/installer.ps1 | iex
~~~

You can find detailed instructions in getting the latest version of the Antenna App at &#60;https://rsdoiel.github.io/antennaApp/INSTALL.html&#62;.

## Build a simple website

On your computer open the Terminal application. The basic steps you&#39;ll be taking are the following.

1. Create a project directory, &#34;simple&#34;, and change into it
2. Use the Antenna App to setup your site using the &#34;init&#34; command
3. Create a home page in Markdown called &#34;index.md&#34;
4. Generate the HTML page, &#34;index.html&#34; using Antenna
5. Preview your website in your web browser

Here is what you type in the terminal for steps one through two.

~~~shell

mkdir simple
cd simple
antenna init
~~~

If you look at the contents of that directory.

~~~shell

ls
~~~

You should see the following files in the simple directory.

~~~shell

antenna.yaml
page.yaml
~~~

These files are used by Antenna App to generate your website. The &#34;antenna.yaml&#34; is the main configuration file. The &#34;page.yaml&#34; file is used by Antenna App to know how to construct an HTML page.

For step three we need to use a text editor. On Raspberry Pi mousepad is the the default editor. On Windows it is notepad and macOS its textedit. Many people use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor which is available on macOS, Windows and Raspberry Pi OS. That is what I&#39;ll be using in my examples. You can change the &#34;code&#34; references to the editor you prefer.

On my Raspberry Pi I can run the editor creating &#34;index.md&#34; when I save it. Here is the command I type into my terminal to do that.

~~~shell

code index.md
~~~

In the editor window you should see an empty file. Type in the following and save the file as &#34;index.md&#34; in the simple directory.

~~~markdown

Hello World! 

~~~

Now we want to use Antenna App &#34;page&#34; command to turn that &#34;index.md&#34; into our home web page. This is the command you type into your Terminal window.

~~~shell

antenna page index.md
~~~

If you check the contents of the simple directory.

~~~shell

ls
~~~

You should see three four files now.

~~~

antenna.yaml
index.md
index.html
page.yaml
~~~

We can new preview the website by run the Antenna App&#39;s &#34;preview&#39; command. This command runs a little web server on your computer so you can view the results of your handy work in your web browser.

~~~shell

antenna preview
~~~

Started your web browser and open the URL &#60;http://localhost:8000&#62;.  You should see your Hello World homepage. If you open &#60;view-source:http://localhost:8000&#62; you&#39;ll see the HTML source generated by the &#34;page&#34; command. When you are finished go back to your Terminal window and hold down the control key and press the &#34;C&#34; key (Ctrl-C). This exits the preview command. If you reload the pages in your web browser you&#39;ll get your browser&#39;s default page indicating that the pages are not available.

### Expanding our site

Our site isn&#39;t useful website yet. There are no links. Modify &#34;index.md&#34; file to look like this.

~~~markdown

# Hello World!

Learn about [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) on
John Grubber&#39;s website &#60;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#62;.

~~~

Once you&#39;ve saved this revision use the page command to update the HTML. After that run the preview command like before. Switch back to your terminal and type the following.

~~~shell

antenna page index.md
antenna preview
~~~

Refresh (reload) your web browser page for the URL &#60;http://localhost:8000&#62;.  Our &#34;Hello World&#34; homepage, &#34;index.md&#34;, now should be transformed with &#34;Hello World&#34; displaying as a heading and our added paragraph with links to Wikipedia and Daring Fireball websites. Refresh the &#34;view-source&#34; version of the pages and see the additional HTML markup generated by the page command.

### Elaboration

A single page website is very limited.  You can create more pages going through the process we used for &#34;index.md&#34;. Here&#39;s the basic sequence.

1. create or edit the markdown document in your editor, save it
2. use the page command to render the HTML version
3. use the preview command and your web browser to see your handy work

Let&#39;s add a page called &#34;fruit.md&#34; with a list of heading and list fruits.

~~~shell

code fruit.md
~~~

Here&#39;s the text of the fruits.md page.

~~~Markdown

# Fruit

- Dragon Fruit
- Lime
- Mango

~~~

You turn the page into HTML using the page command and then preview the website again

~~~shell

antenna page fruit.md
antenna preview
~~~

You have two pages in your website now. The URL are

- http://localhost:8000/index.html
- http://localhost:8000/fruit.html

Look at each in your web browser. Notice the pages aren&#39;t linked in anyway. That&#39;s not ideal. What we need is an easy way to navigation the main pages of our site. Antenna App supports a concept called themes. This let&#39;s you define how a page is generated through assigning content to specific parts of the page. One of the parts of an Antenna generated page is called &#34;nav&#34; and it is expressed as Markdown. Other parts include header, footer, top_content and bottom_content (the last two are before and after the section holding the contents our   original Markdown documents). 

To create a theme we need to first create a directory. Then we need to include the desired parts in the theme. Let&#39;s create a theme that has the nav element for our website that will make it easy to switch from the homepage to the fruit page. The steps we&#39;ll take to create our theme follows.

1. create a directory called &#34;theme&#34;
2. create a file in the &#34;theme&#34; directory called &#34;nav.md&#34;
3. Add two links using Markdown to &#34;nav.md&#34; and save the file
4. &#34;apply&#34; our theme
5. regenerate our HTML pages and preview the site

Here&#39;s what I&#39;d type in the terminal for steps one and two.

~~~shell

mkdir theme
code theme/nav.md
~~~

The content to type into &#34;nav.md&#34; is as follows.

~~~Markdown

[home](index.html) [fruit](fruit.html)
~~~

Save the result then in the terminal window type the following to finish steps four and five.

~~~shell

antenna apply theme
antenna page index.md
antenna page fruit.md
antenna preview
~~~

You can now refresh the browser pages and exploring our site by clicking on the links provided by the navigation.

## Antenna Themes

An Antenna App theme is defined as a directory with Markdown files to express the visible common HTML elements. Other non-visible elements in the head element of an HTML page are also able to be set with in a theme. Those aren&#39;t expressed in Markdown. Here&#39;s the names of files which are recognized by the Antenna App as valid parts of a theme.

- header.md
- nav.md
- top_content.md
- bottom_content.md
- footer.md
- head.yaml
- style.css

The files ending with &#34;.md&#34; are Markdown files. Markdown describes the content we want to include in those sections of our webpage. Any Markdown content can be used. If one of the files does not exist in the theme then that element is not populated in the resulting page. Example if you include nav.md then navigation will be included otherwise it will not be included. The page order of the Markdown elements are 

1. header.md
2. nav.md
3. top_content.md
4. The content of the Markdown document used with the page command
5. bottom_content.md
6. footer.md

When we create a file like &#34;index.md&#34; and &#34;fruits.md&#34; the resulting HTML is inserted between the &#34;top_content&#34; and &#34;bottom_content&#34; sections of the webpage. 

To keep things simple I started by showing you how to create the &#34;nav&#34; element using the &#34;nav.md&#34; site your theme folder.
The theme name can be anything, it&#39;s just a directory. Here&#39;s the basic steps in creating a new theme

1. create a directory to hold the theme parts
2. Inside your directory create Markdown documents for the parts of the them you want defined
3. Apply the theme by using the directory name and the apply command 
4. Generate or regenerate HTML for each page in your site
5. Preview the site

Editing the theme is just a matter of adding, editing or removing elements from the theme folder. The two elements that are not Markdown documents are &#34;style.css&#34; and &#34;head.yaml&#34; if you choose to include them. The &#34;style.css&#34; file should contain valid CSS.
The &#34;head.yaml&#34; gives you find grained control of the meta, link and script elements that get rendered into the head element of your web page.

### Spicing pages up with CSS

So far the website is functional but relies on the defaults provided by your web browser. The visual appearance can be enhanced through using CSS. CSS is a language that describes to the web browser how it should layout the HTML page contents. The Antenna App&#39;s themes supports embedding a style element in the HTML page&#39;s head element by including a &#34;style.css&#34; file inside the theme directory. Let&#39;s do that now.

Use your terminal to create &#34;theme/style.css&#34;

~~~shell

code theme/style.css
~~~

Paste in the follow CSS. It&#39;ll turn your top level page titles vertical using CSS.

~~~css

/* Turn the H1 elements vertical */
h1 {
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
  transform: rotate(180deg);
  text-orientation: mixed;
}
~~~

After creating and save the &#34;style.css&#34; you theme directory should have two files.

~~~

theme/nav.md
theme/style.css
~~~

You can now apply the theme, regenerate the HTML pages and preview them.

~~~shell

antenna apply theme
antenna page index.md
antenna page fruits.md
antenna preview
~~~

When you preview the site you should see the effect the CSS had on how the page displayed. The changes to layout using CSS can be very elaborate and CSS is a topic I encourage you to explore on your own. A good reference and tutorial website for CSS is &#60;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS&#62;. A historic example of what people have done with CSS can be seen at [CSS Zen Garden](https://csszengarden.com/). A web search on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com?q=learning CSS) or other search engine will turn up lots of additional resources. There are also book available through [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/search?q=CSS&#38;mode=everything).

## Next steps

- Create a few more pages for your website using Markdown for the text content
- Explore adding additional theme elements like &#34;header&#34; and &#34;footer&#34;

Happy site building!</source:markdown>

To create a theme we need to first create a directory. Then we need to include the desired parts in the theme. Let&#39;s create a theme that has the nav element for our website that will make it easy to switch from the homepage to the fruit page. The steps we&#39;ll take to create our theme follows.

1. create a directory called &#34;theme&#34;
2. create a file in the &#34;theme&#34; directory called &#34;nav.md&#34;
3. Add two links using Markdown to &#34;nav.md&#34; and save the file
4. &#34;apply&#34; our theme
5. regenerate our HTML pages and preview the site

Here&#39;s what I&#39;d type in the terminal for steps one and two.

~~~shell

mkdir theme
code theme/nav.md
~~~

The content to type into &#34;nav.md&#34; is as follows.

~~~Markdown

[home](index.html) [fruit](fruit.html)
~~~

Save the result then in the terminal window type the following to finish steps four and five.

~~~shell

antenna apply theme
antenna page index.md
antenna page fruit.md
antenna preview
~~~

You can now refresh the browser pages and exploring our site by clicking on the links provided by the navigation.

## Antenna Themes

An Antenna App theme is defined as a directory with Markdown files to express the visible common HTML elements. Other non-visible elements in the head element of an HTML page are also able to be set with in a theme. Those aren&#39;t expressed in Markdown. Here&#39;s the names of files which are recognized by the Antenna App as valid parts of a theme.

- header.md
- nav.md
- top_content.md
- bottom_content.md
- footer.md
- head.yaml
- style.css

The files ending with &#34;.md&#34; are Markdown files. Markdown describes the content we want to include in those sections of our webpage. Any Markdown content can be used. If one of the files does not exist in the theme then that element is not populated in the resulting page. Example if you include nav.md then navigation will be included otherwise it will not be included. The page order of the Markdown elements are 

1. header.md
2. nav.md
3. top_content.md
4. The content of the Markdown document used with the page command
5. bottom_content.md
6. footer.md

When we create a file like &#34;index.md&#34; and &#34;fruits.md&#34; the resulting HTML is inserted between the &#34;top_content&#34; and &#34;bottom_content&#34; sections of the webpage. 

To keep things simple I started by showing you how to create the &#34;nav&#34; element using the &#34;nav.md&#34; site your theme folder.
The theme name can be anything, it&#39;s just a directory. Here&#39;s the basic steps in creating a new theme

1. create a directory to hold the theme parts
2. Inside your directory create Markdown documents for the parts of the them you want defined
3. Apply the theme by using the directory name and the apply command 
4. Generate or regenerate HTML for each page in your site
5. Preview the site

Editing the theme is just a matter of adding, editing or removing elements from the theme folder. The two elements that are not Markdown documents are &#34;style.css&#34; and &#34;head.yaml&#34; if you choose to include them. The &#34;style.css&#34; file should contain valid CSS.
The &#34;head.yaml&#34; gives you find grained control of the meta, link and script elements that get rendered into the head element of your web page.

### Spicing pages up with CSS

So far the website is functional but relies on the defaults provided by your web browser. The visual appearance can be enhanced through using CSS. CSS is a language that describes to the web browser how it should layout the HTML page contents. The Antenna App&#39;s themes supports embedding a style element in the HTML page&#39;s head element by including a &#34;style.css&#34; file inside the theme directory. Let&#39;s do that now.

Use your terminal to create &#34;theme/style.css&#34;

~~~shell

code theme/style.css
~~~

Paste in the follow CSS. It&#39;ll turn your top level page titles vertical using CSS.

~~~css

/* Turn the H1 elements vertical */
h1 {
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
  transform: rotate(180deg);
  text-orientation: mixed;
}
~~~

After creating and save the &#34;style.css&#34; you theme directory should have two files.

~~~

theme/nav.md
theme/style.css
~~~

You can now apply the theme, regenerate the HTML pages and preview them.

~~~shell

antenna apply theme
antenna page index.md
antenna page fruits.md
antenna preview
~~~

When you preview the site you should see the effect the CSS had on how the page displayed. The changes to layout using CSS can be very elaborate and CSS is a topic I encourage you to explore on your own. A good reference and tutorial website for CSS is &#60;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS&#62;. A historic example of what people have done with CSS can be seen at [CSS Zen Garden](https://csszengarden.com/). A web search on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com?q=learning CSS) or other search engine will turn up lots of additional resources. There are also book available through [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/search?q=CSS&#38;mode=everything).

## Next steps

- Create a few more pages for your website using Markdown for the text content
- Explore adding additional theme elements like &#34;header&#34; and &#34;footer&#34;

Happy site building!</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown># Computer related words that bug me

Sometimes specific terms bug me on popular usage. This is particularly true when related to computer science (or better term, information science). 

Two terms really grate on my nerves these days.

1. “AI” was a marketing term to get the DOD to fund researching in to cognitive approaches to computation.  The generals like the term Artificial Intelligence in the 1970s because the idea of robot solders who could be destroyed with out the having to write the letters to their parents was desirable after Vietnam and previous wars. For the researchers it was sufficiently vague to be a goldmine of grant possibilities.
2. Information Security became Cyber Security for marketing reasons

Terms that change for marketing reasons quickly loose meaning. In the computers as communication devices space this isn&#39;t a good feature.

The stupidest phrase I&#39;ve heard a politician and business leaders say in interviews, &#34;We&#39;ve got to have cyber&#34;.  In my head I change &#34;cyber&#34; to &#34;coffee&#34; so I don&#39;t think have to remember their names.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown># Getting started with Go

By R. S. Doiel, 2025-09-22

This is just a quick tutorial covering installing the Go compiler, tool chain and learning the basics through creating three programs -- hello world, a web server and a Markdown server. It is not a [tutorial](https://go.dev/learn/#selected-tutorials) on the Go language. The [Go website](https://go.dev) has that covered. This is really just the bare minimum to get started with the `go` command. 

Here&#39;s the files source files we&#39;ll be using in this tutorial

- [helloworld.go](helloworld/helloworld.go)
- [webserver.go](webserver/webserver.go)
- [markdown.go](mdserver/markdown.go)
- [markdown_test.go](mdserver/markdown_test.go)
- [handler.go](mdserver/handler.go)
- [handler_test.go](mdserver/handler_test.go)
- [mdserver&#39;s main.go](mdserver/cmd/mdserver/main.go)


## Installing Go and making sure it works

 It covers the basics of how the Go compiler and tool change work by walking throw three Go programs. The first one is to create a hello world program to make sure Go is available and working. The steps will be as follows.

1. Download and install Go, see &#60;https://go.dev/dl/&#62; (latest is currently 1.25.1)

## Creating hello world, making sure Go tool chain is working

1. Open a terminal
2. create a directory/folder you&#39;ll use for you creating a hello world program
3. Change into that directory
4. Type in the hello world program below and save it as &#34;hello.go&#34;
5. Try running &#34;hello.go&#34;
6. Follow the instruction to &#34;build&#34; the hello.go program (you&#39;re compiling the Go source into an executable)
7. Run you newly created executable

Here&#39;s the steps we&#39;ll take starting with step #3.

~~~shell

mkdir helloworld
cd helloworld
edit hello.go
go run hello.go
go build hello.go
./hello
cd ..
~~~

Here&#39;s the source code to hello world in Go

~~~go

package main

import (
    &#34;fmt&#34;
) 

func main() {
    fmt.Println(&#34;Hello World!&#34;)
}
~~~

If you got this far you&#39;ve created your first Go program.

What are the parts of the source code package to take note of?

`package main`
: Identifies what &#34;package&#34; or module that the source file belongs to. The &#34;main&#34; package is special in that it what represents a stand alone program.

`import`
: This is a statement (including the contents inside the parenthesis) that shows what modules your program relies on.

`func`
: This defines a functions, in this case the main function.

`&#34;fmt&#34;`
: This is the name of the module for formatting text, includes functions like Println that display a line of text.

Things to keep in mind.  Go is a typed language. Variables and constants can be declared explicitly or be implicitly used on their first assignment.  Scope is block level like Python, TypeScript or ES6 when using &#34;let&#34;.

Capitalized functions, variables and constants are &#34;exported&#34; from the current module and can be referenced when that package is later imported. When we use the imported &#34;fmt&#34; package with the &#34;Println&#34; function, the fact that it is capitalized means it can be used in the scope of our package. Other things inside of &#34;fmt&#34; which are not capitalized don&#39;t get exported and are not visible inside the current package scope. Capitalization is like the &#34;export&#34; keyword in TypeScript or JavaScript.

Packages and modules are Go&#39;s reusable unit of code. Originally Go called them &#34;packages&#34;, hence the &#34;package&#34; declaration in our program.  There are some technical distinctions. A packages are a collection of Go files in a directory.  They don&#39;t necessarily carry dependencies in them. This can be an issue for you are importing packages that might break between versions. Modules are implemented using packages but carry the dependency information with them so you compiles are consistent regardless of the latest release of a package that was imported. See the &#34;mod&#34; command below.

Let&#39;s look at the go command before looking at the source code. The go command is actually a collection of tools. The commons I used most frequently are the following.

run
: Run the main package Go file

build
: This compiles the program into an executable. It can also be used to cross compile if you set some environment variables

fmt
: Format the source code to a standard set by the Go community

vet
: Perform analysis on your Go source file(s) and indicate potential issues

We&#39;ll use the following two when we build our web server since it&#39;ll be constructed as a module.

mod
: Setup and maintain go module (this is be covered later)

test
: Test a go module (e.g. files that end in &#34;_test.go&#34;)

## Build a static web server

We&#39;ll be doing the following next.

1. Create a new directory for our web server
2. Change into it.
3. Go to the http package docs, &#60;https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#example-FileServer-DotFileHiding&#62;
4. Copy the example for the dot file hiding file server and save as webserver.go
5. Create a hello world index.html file.
6. Use Go &#34;run&#34; our static web server

~~~shell

mkdir webserver
cd webserver
edit webserver.go
edit hello.html
go run webserver.go
# You can open your web browser to http://localhost:8080/hello.html
cd ..
~~~

## Build a Markdown web server

1. Create a new directory called &#34;mdserver&#34;
2. Change into it
3. Initialize the Go module we&#39;ll build (e.g. &#39;github.com/rsdoiel/mdserver&#39;, you&#39;d use something that makes sense for you)
4. Add a Go modules for working with Markdown, &#34;github.com/yuin/goldmark&#34;
5. Write a function to convert Markdown into HTML in a file called markdown.go
6. Write a test function called MarkdownToHTML in a file called markdown_test.go
7. Run the test to make sure it works
8. Write a the function MarkdownHandler function and save it markdown.go
8. mkdir called &#34;cli&#34;
9. Copy &#34;../webserver/webserver.go&#34; to &#34;cli/mdserver.go&#34;
10. Update &#34;cmd/mdserver/mdserver.go&#34; to import our mdserver package
11. Wrap the dot file handler function with our MarkdownHandler function
12. Using go run to test our web server

~~~shell

mkdir mdserver
cd mdserver
go mod init &#39;github.com/rsdoiel/mdserver&#39;
go mod tidy
go get &#34;github.com/yuin/goldmark&#34;
edit markdown.go
edit markdown_test.go
go test
# Now we&#39;re going to create our handler function and test of it
edit handler.go
edit handler_test.go
go test
# Now let&#39;s create our wrapping cli
mkdir -p cmd/mdserver
copy ../webserver/webserver.go cmd/mdserver/main.go
# Import our mdserver package and wrap the dotFileHandler function with the Markdown function
edit cmd/mdserver/main.go
go run cmd/mdserver/main.go
~~~


We can make a mdserver executable using the build command and specify an output name.

~~~shell

go build -o bin/mdserver cmd/mdserver/main.go
~~~

You&#39;ve not create Go program that is defined by a module/package &#34;mdserver&#34; and runs that package in a command line program. What&#39;s left is to learn the language itself, get familiar with the standard library and write more Go programs.
