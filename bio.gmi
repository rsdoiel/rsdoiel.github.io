I work as a "Digital Services Programmer" (aka. software engineer, software developer, programmer) for the California Institute of Technology Library[1]. In my career I have focused on building web based systems for academic institutions (previously USC, now Caltech).  I bring to the table both B.S. in Computer Science[2] as well as an M.A. in the Humanities[3]. I enjoy diving deeply into a problem and working through solutions that have measurable results.
