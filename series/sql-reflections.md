This series is a collection of reflections and notes as I work with
MySQL 8, SQLite 3 and Postgres 14 in my day job.

3. [PL/pgSQL, a Quick Intro](/blog/2022/08/24/plpgsql-quick-intro.html), notes on starting to write functions and procedures in Postgres 14.5
4. [Postgres 14 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/blog/2022/08/26/postgres-14-on-ubuntu-22.04-LTS.html), quick distillation of setting up Postgres 14 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
