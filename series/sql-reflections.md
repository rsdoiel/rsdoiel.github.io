SQL Reflections
===============

This series is a collection of reflections and notes as I work with
MySQL 8, SQLite 3 and Postgres 14 in my day job. 

- [Rosette](/blog/2022/08/19/rosette-notes.html), notes on moving from MySQL 8 to Postgres 14.5 in a project
- [PL/pgSQL, a Quick Intro](/blog/2022/08/24/plpgsql-quick-intro.html), notes on starting to write functions and procedures in Postgres 14.5
