This is a set of articles based on Kernighan and Plauger's Book,
[Software Tools in Pascal](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL4258115M/Software_tools_in_Pascal), 1981, Addison-Wesley.

The articles follow the structure of the book, with brief discussion
of what was involved in translating from the vintage Standard Pascal 
to Oberon-7. In most cases the Oberon code is more compact and the
features of Oberon avoid the need for macro processors and file
inclusion through the use of modules.
