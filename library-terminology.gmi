## Robert's Library Terminology and Jargon list

This is my running collection of notes to help me remember various terms, abbreviations and concepts I have run across as a software developer working in a Academic/Research library setting.

## Terminology, Acronyms, Concepts

* COAR[15] confederation of open access repositories
* CrossRef[16] * A service returning JSON metadata records based on title, ISSN, etc.

* t piece of text that is algorithmically derived from a file and allows the determination of whether the file has been corrupted.[17] * a free, open source (GPL) OpenURL link resolver and electronic resource management system designed for use by library consortia. It supports multiple sites from one server, online management tools, usage statistics, and an advanced journal list system.
* DAMS * Digital Access Management System
* descriptive metadata * Metadata that describes the intellectual content of a file, as opposed to the physical or structural characteristics of the file.
* Discovery * First phase in a research project (followed by validation) * A discovery product consists of an interface directed toward the users of a library to find materials in its collections and subsequently to gain access to items of interest through the appropriate mechanisms. Discovery products tend to be independent from the specific applications that libraries implement to manage resources, such as integrated library systems, library services platforms, repository platforms, or electronic resource management systems. In most cases they provide access to multiple types of materials, independently of the management platform involved. Discovery products provide an interface with search and retrieval capabilities, often with features such as relevancy-based ordering of search results, facets presented that can be selected to narrow results according to specific categories, contributors, or date ranges, and tools to identify related materials or to refine search queries. Discovery products will use mechanisms appropriate to location, content type and license arrangement to provide access to materials. These mechanisms might include identifying the current location and status of a physical item with service options to request the item be held or delivered, to provide linking or direct viewing or download of articles, chapters, e-books, or other textual items available electronically, and presentation of digital images or multi-media content. Discovery products may also have social features that enable library patrons to comment, review, rate, or recommend content items or to interact dynamically with other patrons. * Also see EDS[18]
* DLF[19] * Digital Library Federation
* DOIÂ®[20] * digital object identifier * A unique, persistent, and actionable digital identifier for a content object. * Note: The DOI syntax is defined in ANSI/NISO Z39.84 and the entire DOI system is defined in ISO 26324. * DOI[21] is a digital object identifier is a unique string identifier for digital resources and resolves to a URL of the document. It includes metadata about the document and how to resolve its location.

* serial item * The smallest self-contained portion of a serial. * Examples: Articles, letters, reviews, case studies, front matter (in contrast to volumes or issues)

* Solr[87] * An open source search platform
* structural metadata * Metadata that is used to illustrate the relationships between a series of files and that allows the reconstruction of a whole from its parts.
* SUSHI[88] * Standardized Usage Statistics Harvesting Initiative. It is a standard protocol (ANSI/NISO Z39.93-2003) that can be used by electronic resource management (ERM) systems (and other systems) to automate the transport of COUNTER formatted usage statistics. It can also be used to retrieve non-COUNTER reports that meet the specified requirements for retrieval by SUSHI.
* UL and AUL are University Librarian and Associate/Assistance University Librarian
* UMI[89] - University Microfilm International (www.umi.com redirects to ProQuest[90]) is currently owned by Bell & Howell
* Z39* * A set of protocol and specifications encompassing client server technology and the interchange of data, metadata, and Metrics * Examples: * Z39.98 * Z39.86 * Z39-7 * Information Services and Use Metrics & Statistics for Libraries and Information Providers â Data Dictionary * Z39.50 * UseZ39.50 to look for records in a catalog or union database allows for better retrieval of records than simply constructing a title or ISBN/ISSN based URL.
